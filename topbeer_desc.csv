"Heady Topper","this is the beer that winners drink. are you a winner?"
"Heady Topper","This is right up there with Tree House and Trillium as one of the Best IPAs I've had."
"Heady Topper","Awesome New England style IPA being the original in a sense.  Some others have caught up and passed this legend."
"Heady Topper","16oz can received courtesy of @JHavs and his mini-assault on my doorstep. While there's a 4-pk holder in the box with a sticker showing a date of June 23, I don't know if it goes with this or one of the other 4 beers he sent me."
"Heady Topper","First I'll start by saying I did not buy into all the hype surrounding this beer. However, when I finally tasted it I was surprised and can understand why this has such a cult following. Great quality and a unique taste that definitely makes this stick out in an over saturated micro brewery market. It is definitely a bit bitter and not incredibly smooth which should come as no surprise, but the floral note and light after taste are addictive. Even those who do not love IPAs will most likely appreciate a can of Heady Topper. Also the art is awesome."
"Heady Topper","Pours an opaque orange-amber with a thin white head.  The aroma is all tropical fruit and citrus leaping from the glass.  Starts off with sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes, fading to a very mild bitter finish.  The malt is more then enough to balance out the bitterness.  It has a full mouthfeel, and is very inviting.  This is a top notch IIPA, and I can see why people are trying to imitate it."
"Heady Topper","Well, ranked ninth overall on August 1st had to try it out. Tasted incredible at brewery itself so if you can go there although sold out for purchase currently but did find some in town for sale. For sure, didnt disappoint. Stunningly light for a double. Deceptively easy to drink for its potency. Did the can drink and yes does make a difference but poured into a true tulip - available at the store for purchase too! Poured light orange gold. Fruit smells abound and a great taste goin down. Worth the hype!"
"Heady Topper","What a great beer!!!! Following instructions, I took the first sips straight from the can. Huge citrus hops presence, mangos, tangerines and grapefruit with a resiny, oily hops finish.  The hop presence is bitter but not a head shrinking hops bomb. There must be a malt balance here somewhere, but the malt does not interfere with the hoppy taste - just provides some balance. The aroma is just  as  impressive as the taste.  OK, its time to have a look at this in a glass.  Pours a hazy, dense straw yellow color into a pint glass.  It takes a hard pour to obtain a big white head, but with a hard pour, the head is large and frothy with excellent retention. Bands of wide lacing on the glass, once again with good retention.  The lacing lasted as long as the beer.  Maybe I'm just falling for the  hype, but I believe I will drink my remaining 3 beers straight from the can,  The aroma and flavor are much more prominent and overpowering straight from the can!!!  Mouthfeel is crisp and rich.  No hint of 8% abv. I could have drank another one and be surprised when the strength caught up with me!!!!  Bitterness is good but not overpowering and the oily resiny presence is surprising considering there is so much citrus in the taste.  I don't go crazy looking for hard-to-find beers anymore, but a friend took this as a challenge and sent me a 4 pack.  If you can find this beer - get it!!!  It is that good!!!!!"
"Heady Topper","The fluffy white foam reaches one inch and lingers for the duration. A fine webbing of lace coats the Spiegelau IIPA glass. The beer is murky gold (SRM 5-6) with casual carbonation throughout."
"Heady Topper","Thin and disappointing, especially because of the huge hype."
"Heady Topper","Drank directly from the can, as recommended."
"Heady Topper","The Winner and Still Champion."
"Heady Topper","One of the best I've had. Very drinkable"
"Heady Topper","Very hop foreword through out the entire drinking process, from cracking the can to swallowing the nectar. Almost too hoppy, like chewing on a pine tree at some points, although still consider it to be an archetypal IIPA (while still probably not my favorite)"
"Heady Topper","500ml can. Yellow liquid with a small white head. Nose is hoppy, fruity, grapefruit, exotic fruits, you can’t just stay there, you need to drink it, it is too inviting, can find some caramel malt as well. Taste is just as amazing as nose, once you take a sip you just can’t stop, abv isn’t even felt, you drink is like this is no tomorrow. A lovely IPA for sure."
"Heady Topper","Pours a beautiful cloudy golden with a dense pillow of white atop (4.25). Aroma is a remarkable balance of sweet malt and juicy hops, no bitterness or overly strong smells, mouth watering (4.5). Flavors are a different animal, with a mighty blast of hop dominating the sip from start to finish. Never harsh, and never too bitter, but always present. You can sense the malt in its backdrop just letting the Hops shine (4.75). Finishes ridiculously clean, not too dry, and just asking for another sip (4.75). Overall just fantastic stuff for my tastes (4.5)."
"Heady Topper","Look - slight haze golden color with very slight head"
"Heady Topper","Slightly hazy yellow color with two finger head and consumed in a snifter, sorry... Great floral and hop aromas.  Smooth and creamy texture with cream vanilla and orange citrus flavors.  Big, hoppy and full bodied mouthful, but so well balanced with all the other flavors.  This is one of the smoothest and tastiest  IIPA's I've ever had!"
"Heady Topper","2017 review:"
"Heady Topper","I am no beer connoisseur. I do not know the lingo, or even how to describe a taste so well. All I can say is is, that this my favorite beer to date. I started getting into IPA's on a trip to Burlington/Stowe last summer, and since have been on a search for delicious IPA's. This is the best I have had, hands down. Gorgeous, deliciousness, wonderful buzz feeling. I look forward to visiting my friends country house again to indulge!"
"Heady Topper","All of these components are close to being a 5, great IPA! The smell is definitely a 5. I enjoyed this emensly, definitely seek it out. Again I have to thank my buddy Dave!"
"Heady Topper","Too many hops for one sip. It needs more balance, whether that be balancing with the grain, or balancing with the variety of hops. It's like saying the best chili is the hottest chili."
"Heady Topper","This was the first IPA that I fell in love with. Hop city is an understatement. Cloudy as all get out, juicy with some hop burn. Great beer."
"Heady Topper","too bitter. somewhat disappointed."
"Heady Topper","A beer that excels in balance. Most NE IPA's are being built around this beer as the example. It's lush, vibrant, yet restrained. "
"Heady Topper","Not usually a fan of IPA, but this one is truly exceptional. The hops are in perfect balance with the sweetness from the malt. The flavor profile is intense and complex yet smooth and enjoyable; without question it lives up to it's reputation.  The Bavarian brewers would be jealous of this beer."
"Heady Topper","The hype is real! Was able to finally procure this beer from a guy who lives in VT. Thanks so much, Jason! Amazing Beer! Definitely in my top 5 of all time."
"Heady Topper","Hard to beat this perfect IPA."
"Heady Topper","One was poured into a snifter and the other was drank out of the can. The appearance in the snifter was a hazy burnt orange color with a ton of floaties surrounding the body. The head was about a finger’s worth of white foaminess. There was some light lacing sticking nicely to the sides of the glass. The smell out of the can and glass was basically the same as it was pure citrus to piney hops that ended up assaulting my nose in a nice bitter/dank sort of way. The taste between the can and the glass was the same as it was pure bittersweetness from the hops. Even as this one warms, the sweetness comes from the hops and not the malts. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation was sharp due to the style and was much expected. Overall, an absolutely wonderful DIPA to me."
"Heady Topper","This is the epitome of an IPA, we have a house 40 minutes from the Alchemist brewery and this beer was one of the main reasons we decided to buy a ski house in Vermont. Only negative thing I have to say is it leaves you a little thirsty. Has a big bite to it so be wary."
"Heady Topper","This is the perfect use of hops. Never have I had a better IPA and I doubt I ever will. Well worth a trip to Vermont to pick up a few four packs of this fine craftsmanship."
"Heady Topper","Look is hazy dark straw with bright white head."
"Heady Topper","It is, without a doubt, my go-to beer."
"Heady Topper","I clearly cannot add anything that hasn't already been said. "
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy lighter straw yellow with a nice bright white head. Decent lacing down the glass. Nose is dominated by citrus. Grapefruit pith and orange peal. Taste is also citrus forward. Very bright and crisp clean citrus fruits that yields way to pine bark. Getting a bit of that oniony taste that sometimes crops up but it is very light and minimal. Beer gets juicier as it warms. Medium body with a bright clean finish to it. Nice little bitter kick as it goes down that reminds you your're drinking a fine Heady Topper. Glad I finally tried this one"
"Heady Topper",Perfect
"Heady Topper","From Bierkrafr. In Teku glass. Watching Looper. Resinous, with pineapple notes. Very balanced and tasty but wont give it full score because some subtle veggie notes not completely pleasant"
"Heady Topper","Not a beer expert by any means, just some who likes beer. To me it definitely got better as the beer got warmer and I felt that it was better out of the can. My expectations were set pretty high. Definitely a great beer, but I was expecting more."
"Heady Topper","Perfectly balance. Strong hop punch to start with a smooth citrus finish that cruises you into the sunset"
"Heady Topper","Lots of grapefruit, hazy. Very reminiscent of Hair of the Dog's Blue Dot when it was good."
"Heady Topper","Look: Out of a can but I know the hazy Heady from many experiences. "
"Heady Topper","A friend of mine brought one down from a visit to the brewery for me.  Nothing better than owing a Top 10 beer to a friend, I returned the favor with Pliny the Elder.  "
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed from a can. "
"Heady Topper","Beer is a light golden orange color and very hazy. A massive 3 finger head settles down to about one finger after a few minutes, very good head retentention. Aromas of dank pine hit you up front followed by citrus, grapefruit, and esters. The taste is a hop bomb of pine and bitterness with subtle notes of grapefruit. There are also biscuit notes from the malt as the beer warms up. The beer is carbonated very dry giving it a very hop forward character. Overall a world class beer."
"Heady Topper","No ""canned on"" or ""enjoy by"" date, but the pack was picked up from the brewery about a week ago, so pretty effing fresh, and poured into the only glass available, a narrow cylindrical pint glass at my inn. Pours a suuuper hazy bright golden color with about an inch or so of stable white head and leaves hella lacing all the way down. Smell is just a bit faint but is exactly what I want from a NE IPA. Loads of pine resin and grapefruit zest/juice. Taste is on point. Balanced, but still rather in-your-face dank resinous character, the same citrusy pop but way more juicy and bold on the palate than on the nose. As you swallow, the pine character builds up even more and lingers on the tongue for ages. Medium body with medium carbonation, all adding to the surprisingly balanced character of this beer. Overall, it may deserve all the hype it gets, but there is a reason this is so sought after. This stuff is bangin'! Super hoppy and yet still finds its proper balance, at least as much balance as an IIPA can really have. Feeling lucky to have gotten this. Sidenote- is highly recommend not drinking straight from the can, regardless of what it says. I did half in the can and half in a glass, and dammit, the glass really does a lot for the aroma. Just don't worry about the floaty bits. That's just character."
"Heady Topper","Drinking first half from the can"
"Heady Topper","I think I may have had an old can of this....Got a very malty backbone and a weird sweetness"
"Heady Topper","Very smooth and flavorful beer."
"Heady Topper","still my favorite beer despite trying all the other contenders here in New England (i.e. Julius, Sip of Sunshine, etc.).  the last batch I picked up at the brewery is just perfect.  however, I seemed to notice that within 4 weeks of canning it seems to be the best."
"Heady Topper","It's the gold standard.  You may try others and think they are better.  But you'll always come back and say this is great."
"Heady Topper","This beer just doesn't live up to the hype for me.  An exceptional beer that I'd always be happy to drink but leaves me feeling underwhelmed.  For me it doesn't stand up to what Tree House and Trillium are doing.  Probably just my personal taste, everybody seems to love it."
"Heady Topper","I just had the chance to have this stand alone beer for the first time this weekend and let me tell you it has all the characturistics of a World champion... oh thats right it it won four years in a row !!! I drank it out of the can as directed so as for color I can only figure it is great in color... to go along with the rest of my review. The taste is superb from the beginning to the end. The choice of hops is top notch with a smooth  mouth feel with several different fruit notes with a great finish. It is a beer to sit, relax, and enjoy, but tough to do. Since you want to keep going back for more mouth euphoria."
"Heady Topper","I drank this beer from the can as it indicates to do on the label. Hits all the marks for me. It has a great hoppy flavor and aroma. As one reviewer mentioned, it is a hop bomb in your mouth. It goes down very smoothly. Perfect amount of carbonation and just enough bite at the end. If you get the chance, read the can, it is pretty funny."
"Heady Topper","cloud orange pour ( N.E. IPA normal) with  decent amount of fuzzy, white head"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass."
"Heady Topper","Probably the best beer I've ever had, and I'm not one to over hype IPAs. It's everything you've heard and more."
"Heady Topper","Bright floral, first IPA I every had that was a super hoppy resin IPA"
"Heady Topper","One of the best double Ipa's I have ever tasted."
"Heady Topper","To the eye. A beautiful blonde color pale somewhat orange but hardly. Beautiful thick and aerated sparkling collar very great remarkable effervescence in this following to the observation of the beautiful big bubbles rising quickly towards the top of the glass. Color rather cloudy but not completely opaque."
"Heady Topper","Look - Pours a hazy honey color, two fingers of bone white head. Great retention, lacing all the way down the glass. Worthy of a picture."
"Heady Topper",OVERRATED
"Heady Topper","The beer that got me into my very expensive hobby."
"Heady Topper",Great
"Heady Topper","drank straight from the can so look is from memory as I've had this beer several times and look varies depending on age. I'm guessing this can is 6-8 weeks old."
"Heady Topper","Awesome, awesome beer from a great brewer.  Everything from Alchemist is terrific, but this one is special.  Drink it right from the can, like the can suggests, and you won't be disappointed."
"Heady Topper","Can definitely testify to the validity of this ale. A friend of mine was extremely emphatic about it and got some for me after visiting Vermont. Definitely one one of the best I've ever had"
"Heady Topper","Had a customer from Vermont at the store I work at in Rhode Island bring this in for me.  I'm a big fan of citrusy IPA's."
"Heady Topper","This beer is more than just a beer but an event HAHA.  The color is amazing bright hazy yellow.  The flavors on the pallet are grapefruit, orange peel, lemon.  Lots of citrus, with a ton of bitter flavor."
"Heady Topper","This is an overall consensus from having drank easily over a hundred Headys since the canning inception. We have a saying around here, if there's nothing exciting on tap: ""Fine, I'll bitch out and have a Heady."" I've had it on draft locally as well as sampled from the old cannery and the new brewery. I've had a year old Heady that was crystal clear and absolutely spectacular. Unless it's poorly kept or somehow oxidized, it never sucks. The recipe has changed over time but the enjoyment never fades!"
"Heady Topper","Poured a bit into the glass but drank this from the can as directed. A hazy bright yellow-golden color with a resilient white head. Big aromas of grapefruit, pine, tangerines. Huge hops on the palate, similar to the nose. A nice bitter mix of the citrus and the resiny, piney earth tones. Medium-bodied and perfectly carbed. Awesome beer."
"Heady Topper","Amazing beer."
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can. Poured a bit into a tulip to see the color. "
"Heady Topper","Bought this on a trip, was flying home, wish I would have drove.  I wish I could have a case shipped to Louisiana."
"Heady Topper","I have had the pleasure of drinking this former #1 several years in a row now. 2017 now and it still lives up to the hype every year. Gave it a 5 on look cause I never have poured it out to look at it, so I rated the awesome can art. I will be awaiting next year's tasting ."
"Heady Topper","This legendary eastern ipa is what inspired my signing up to ba to launch this bashing..err review.   I like Maine beers, I like knee deep beers, i like mosaic hops.  Honestly I was ecstatic when my buddy brought home a plethora of alchemist beers.  Focal banger should be right up my alley but its so over the top i have to blend it but when i do i still enjoy big mosaic hops.  Heady is just foul.  I realize my opinion is an outlier but when I tell you I struggled to finish a can (ipa drinking wife included) Im very serious.  I had it on 2 occasions to cement my feelings on it and they are this beer is soooooooooooooooo overrated I'm in awe of how lousy it was for me, really nothing redeeming to say other than at 8%abv if you can hold your  nose and slam a few of these i guess you'll be in a happy place but i can give you myriad other options to better get you there."
"Heady Topper",**
"Heady Topper","I have been to the mountain top"
"Heady Topper","A fantastic beer and a rare find. The beer lives up to its reputation as being one of the best around. For a tousle IPA, it has a subtle hoppy finish with a very complicated taste. Definitely drink from the can, its intriguing and complex."
"Heady Topper","This beer has its reputation for a reason. Glad I was finally able to score 1!"
"Heady Topper","The anticipation was enormous, the taste was pretty good. A friend had to take two work days off to drive to Vermont to pick up two cans for me. It was pretty good, but so are others right here in Ontario, CAN."
"Heady Topper","Outstanding IPA, very tropical, grapefruit, orange and pineapple. It's juicy and pithy with tons of pine. The bitter finish lingers for a bit longer than I'd like, but overall I can't complain about this beer. It's absolutely world class."
"Heady Topper","Really just a perfect beer. Enjoyed first in Burlington at a Nepalese restaurant and recently thanks to a generous friend who sent a 4 pack of this and Focal. Really just a standout beer."
"Heady Topper","Look: Orange, hazy, with a two inch head."
"Heady Topper","Poured out to share with a friend. Cloudy golden yellow color with a small white head. It smelled of tropical fruits and caramel sweetness. Good balance of bitter and sweet."
"Heady Topper","Can of course"
"Heady Topper","1 PINT can"
"Heady Topper","I base my taste of other beer around this one."
"Heady Topper","This is the  sweetest nectar to touch my lips with the exception of my beautiful wifes love juice.  I have 6 more of the nectar of the gods that I will enjoy only on the most special occasions."
"Heady Topper","It was everything I heard"
"Heady Topper","highly overrated...try JVP (Joseph Vincent Paterno) instead of this"
"Heady Topper","having this on tap at the alchemist reopened my eyes at how good this beer is"
"Heady Topper","Thanks for the trade Ross!  Color is a vibrant yellow-straw with minimal haze....I had to pour a few ounces into a tasting glass despite the command to drink from the can. Didn't pour enough to get any discernible head.  The smell is outrageous with lemon, orange, hop resin...it really is a delightful smell.  The taste is very juicy and it doesn't get washed out by the carbonation or hops. I am getting an orange rind and piney dry finish.  A medium-full body with a soft mouth-feel, again the carbonation is present but not overpowering, this is particularly applicable when consumed from the can.  "
"Heady Topper","Had this on the Jersey Shire out of the can as suggested on the label. Very tasty. Lived up to expectations, which were on the high end. Most notable for that complex cloudy almost resinous, multidimensional flavor and look."
"Heady Topper","Drank from can as intended"
"Heady Topper","Probably the most overrated beer I've ever had. (Have not had Pliny yet)"
"Heady Topper","I poured a nice tulip half way and left some head. Great golden color. A very light hop in my opinion. Nothing stands out and smacks you in the face - that's good. A nice balance. Some fruit notes but nothing that stands out or leaves a bad or bitter taste."
"Heady Topper","Look: Poured approx. 1 to 2 oz into tulip glass for look purposes only, the rest drank from the can. Pours a light gold/yellow color. Translucent, and moderately cloudy. Leaves some small and big bubbles with a small amount of white head. Leaves a characteristic lacing around the glass."
"Heady Topper","Drove to the new Alchemist and purchased the max of each beer. I've had Heady-Topper before, and was very excited to taste the joys of my 12 hour round trip drive. "
"Heady Topper","So I tried this amazing beer for the first time... holy mother of all beers was t amazing I had Lord Hobos consulation prize at my all time fav. but heady & topper well, tops it lol I'm in love all over again."
"Heady Topper","Nosed f-Ed this guy for awhile. Loved it."
"Heady Topper","It goes without saying that this is an exceptional beer. Appearance is a cloudy gold (thank you for not turning this into a murky swamp beer like some of your peers), small and taste continues to be a tidal wave of perfectly balanced hops."
"Heady Topper","I must be a terrible man, but I don't drink this beer from the can.   I can't say anything different or add much to the reviews below, but this may be the perfect IPA, and deserves to be enjoyed with every sense."
"Heady Topper","A: From the can, it looks like a can. In the glass, it pours a beautiful, semi-opaque, sunshiney gold with a fluffy white, rocky head that laces well."
"Heady Topper","It's a truly awesome beer."
"Heady Topper","Needless to say...Alchemist lived up to the reputation. This was a the first time experiencing Heady. Tried it in a glass at first in the brewery. Then drank another the next day in the can as it said to. It was rather smooth to be honest with you. Flavors of citrus was well balanced with the hoppy taste. Overall very happy I was able to get my hands on some."
"Heady Topper","My favorite beer so far, its delicious"
"Heady Topper","Pouring Heady Topper from the ""Drink from the Can"" pint can reveals a hazy, fiery orange liquid with a foamy, tightly laced, white head. Head foams up quickly, peaking at 3 fingers with an aggressive start and conservative finish. Retention on the head is great, lasting even through a half dozen sips. Lacing bubbles around the glass, with great retention. Aroma is steeped in layers of citrus, with notes of orange, lemon zest, and papaya. Biscuit malts bunch up just behind the hops to form an assertive, but refreshingly delicate hoppy aroma. Flavor profile opens with a smooth crescendo of citrus, orange, lemon zest, and biscuit malts. A hoppy start flexes and reshapes itself into a malty finish - with a little resin hop at the end to stick to the palate. Mouth feel is smooth and somewhat filling with a medium thickness. Feel certainly has a presence, but is still light enough to be enjoyed swiftly on a blisteringly hot day. Overall, a sublime IPA with plenty of flavorful body, and presence. The lack of a bitter stinging finish makes this an easy beer to enjoy for folks both new to IPAs and old. "
"Heady Topper","I have one  a few times a year, always great beer and each time I had a different experience."
"Heady Topper","Undoubtedly a very good DIPA; however, it did not live up to the hype as one of the best beers in the U.S. for me.  In my opinion, it is not even the best beer by The Alchemist (an excellent brewer)."
"Heady Topper","New England DIPA. 8% ABV."
"Heady Topper","LOVE IT"
"Heady Topper","Poured to a tulip glass."
"Heady Topper","Ah, heady topper. Had several times but this is my first time writing a review. Ignored the advice on the can, of course, and poured into a tulip."
"Heady Topper","Have to drink it fresh as the quality slips after about a week."
"Heady Topper","Mostly drank out of can as instructed. Pours hazy gold with a medium head that is foamy doesn't last"
"Heady Topper","Holy sweet mother of pearl that's exceptional. It's a bigger beer than Focal Banger? I get so... 7% vs 8%."
"Heady Topper","13,005th person to tell you this beer is amazing. A must have double IPA."
"Heady Topper","Will always be a favorite."
"Heady Topper","Honestly, best beer I've ever had and I didn't even have it fresh. My aunt who lives in Ireland bought some in the states and she saved some for me when I went and visited her in Ireland."
"Heady Topper","Simply one of the best! My number one of any style beer. Not even going to try and describe it you just have to try it! Just drink it fresh it does loose a little something over time. Best right off the truck or go to the brewery"
"Heady Topper","After a great  family day, of finally skiing with my southern born family, due to military life. I asked for a plain beer...then a great buddy said I had to try this one. I declined, stating I just need any beer. He refused, presenting me the Heady Topper. I was blown away.  Taste, Smell, Sight,...Best Ever. Been around the world, drank lots of famous beers. Amazed at the taste of Heady Topper. Only problem, I am not the only one who agrees and it's very hard to get. Impossible down south."
"Heady Topper","One of my favs"
"Heady Topper","I'm not one for IPAs, so I had to check my bias, but I can see why Heady Topper is hyped like it is. I first drank it straight from the can as recommended, ice cold at a restaurant in Burlington. It goes down unbelievably smooth for a Double IPA, and it finishes just as clean. The flavor is filled to the brim with high quality hops. Not my cup of tea, but for the IPA freak, it's worth the trip to cozy Vermont."
"Heady Topper","L-clear, often with little floaters"
"Heady Topper","I have been digging NE IPAs since they've been so big lately in SoCal and decided to spend a wad getting this (fresh) out west, it was way worth it. I also ordered Crushed and Focal Banger as part of the haul, but this is the original so he goes first. Poured the first HT into a cold tulip glass without swirling to peep the glory then the second out of the can. The can experience was far better, I actually preferred it colder. Nice light yellow hazy honey color with a finger high head and pretty lacing which coated the glass even after it was gone."
"Heady Topper","Fortunate enough to bring in the new year with two cans.  Neighbor had a friend bring some down in September...keeping the cans ice cold the entire way to Maryland.  I was forced to drink it from the can...per the instructions and the insistence of my neighbor, so the look and smell are both 5.  Taste was very good, but didn't blow me away.  The mouthfeel was very good for a double IPA and I never did want to stop drinking it.  I want it more now that I can't easily get it here in Maryland.  Will be road tripping to Vermont very soon.  I want to try it poured into a cold pint glass."
"Heady Topper","Poured from can into snifter (couldn't quite follow the can rules). Hazy straw color with fluffy white head that had excellent retention and lacing. Scent was grapefruit, lemon, a touch of mango, and very piny. The flavor followed the scent with a high bitterness that was balanced well with the smooth sweet malt. Quite a resinous taste/feel on this one. The mouthfeel made this beer stand out. I've only had a few beers that match this mouthfeel on an IPA, almost seems to coat your mouth with smoothness while maintaining a crispness from the carbonation. Great beer!"
"Heady Topper","I'm guessing the few bad reviews are the result of someone getting an old can or one that got too warm.  I generally do not like IPA'so that are over 7% ABV - too many hops to mask the sweetness. This ale is so well balanced and not at all heavy. My son who goes to school in Vermont brought me a case for Christmas. The best gift I've ever gotten. Truly lives up to the hype.  It is extremely important that you do not let this ale get warm, that will totally funk it ul."
"Heady Topper","First time trying to coveted brew. It was about 8 days old."
"Heady Topper","First time! Poured into IPA glass.  It pours a lovely golden-amber color with two full fingers of fluffy, egg-white head and lacing with excellent retention.  I don't understand why so many claim it has to be drunk from the can because of its appearance.  It's a very attractive pour.  It smells of bready malt, grass, pine needles, lemon peel, and grapefruit. Wow, what a perfect balance of malt, fruit, and hops.  The first taste is the somewhat sweet, bready malt.  It's no fruit bomb; the citrus is subtle, delicate.  There are touches of tropical sweetness and vanilla, particularly as the glass warms a little.  Then the hops explode, bitter and biting.  The after taste is bitter - in a good way.  This ale it medium-bodied, with pleasant carbonation, and a reasonable 8% ABV that allows for easy drinking.  You can down a couple of these.  Overall, it's an exquisite DIPA and merits its lofty ratings.  I'm glad I was finally able to experience it.  Road trip to Vermont?"
"Heady Topper","One of my favorites.  Wish I could get it more often."
"Heady Topper","Damn. Finally got my hands on this and I can honestly say it lives up to the hype."
"Heady Topper","Creature of habit, I opened it and immediately poured it into  tulip glass.  Sorry bro...."
"Heady Topper","While instructed to drink from the can, most of the review (besides the first few smells and sips) was poured into my Pliny the Elder pint glass (ironic, I know). "
"Heady Topper","One of my favorite beers!"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into a tulip for review purposes. Only available in Vermont, acquired through a trade. "
"Heady Topper","Good beer, I was expecting more."
"Heady Topper","Can't rate the look since it's canned. I actually expected more of a pungent kick from such an esteemed IPA but the overall character and mouth feel is very tame. Subtle dryness with moderate grassy/pine notes. Fairly light on the carbonation as well. Overall, a fantastic beer but a little underwhelming I must say. On par with the Jacks Abby Kiwi Rising I tried last week which isn't nearly as exclusive."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper has a hoppy smell with a hazy look.  This tastes like a mouthful of hops and the feeling is a great one.  Overall, I feel like this is a drink you can't pass on."
"Heady Topper","Finally acquired a couple cans in a trade. It was quite tasty!  Had the first can from a glass, beautiful hazy orange gold, nice hoppy aroma, citrusy piney taste but a little weaker than expected. Second can from the can and definitely much better, taste lingered on the palate, very smooth texture. A very good brew!"
"Heady Topper","From a 16oz can at a Burlington restaurant. I had to ask for a glass to look at it, which received a scornful look from the waitress. They do take ""Drink from the Can"" seriously."
"Heady Topper","Seriously amazing.  I was surprised at how smooth and drinkable this beer truly was. I will absolutely seek out again. One thing I did pick up was a faint cucumber taste, but holy cow this thing is amazing."
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy golden yellow with a tinge towards the red spectrum with a good amount of things suspended in the beer.  The smell is rather complex and smells like tropical fruit punch.  Notes of papaya and mango with just a hint of peach.  The taste does not entirely follow the smell but is not nearly as complex.  Tropical fruit juice in the middle but finishes with mango.  The back end is a tad too bitter for my tastes but most would enjoy it.  feel is medium bodied.  Overall this is a really good beer that is a tad too bitter for my own tastes."
"Heady Topper",11/18/16
"Heady Topper","Excellent beer with a nice finish. Taste sits in your mouth with a nice silky feeling long after the last gulp."
"Heady Topper","Was very excited to try this benchmark IPA and am not at all disappointed. It is delicious."
"Heady Topper","Speaks for itself"
"Heady Topper","First had 8/30/13 at a friends house.  One of many, and hopefully many more.  The water in Vermont plays a huge role in all of these fantastic beers that come out of that area.  Or it could be something else, either way, I love when friends go up and bring me some home."
"Heady Topper","As good as advertised. Amazing taste lingers on your toungue. Great aroma upon pour into pint glass.  I actually wasn't blown away by the look but still very pleasant. Lighter than I expected. Great feel and aftertaste. Plus beer as I expected."
"Heady Topper","Finally. A beautiful looking unfiltered beer. The nose was more tame than I expected. Great taste. Super well balanced   Silky smooth feel. A very solid beer. But not the best. Maybe the hype was too much."
"Heady Topper","Bit underwhelming.... maybe too much hype, maybe my expectations were to high, or maybe there are just a lot of other great IPAs out there these days.  It's a great beer, but mostly just a tick off the list."
"Heady Topper","Super excited to try the venerable Heady Topper! I did not drink from the can but I did pour it without rolling the can so as not to disturb the sediment. "
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed it.....it's probably not worth the hype......but it's very very good."
"Heady Topper","Finally tried it.  Had (of course) in the can, though I poured an ounce or two into a teku to get the appearance.  Poured a hazy yellow (thicker, and hazier than most DIPAs).  Pine and citrus on the nose, though not to the incredible extreme of The Crusher.  Palate is tremendously dank, bitter hops.  Pine is more present than citrus, though both certainly play a role in the palate here.  Solid medium mouthfeel.  An exceptional DIPA, but in the world of extremely good IPAs, this one is not so singular as the hype would imply.  Tremendous?  Of course.  Best in its class?  Sadly not."
"Heady Topper","Decent beer, if you're into an IPA.  A little too hoppy for me however."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: yellow-golden with a white head with good retention that fades to a thin lacing. "
"Heady Topper","I have drank almost everything from #1 to #25 and others on the list. I drive to VT every so often to pick up 2 cases and drive back to MA. Why? Simply said, this is the best beer (DIPA) in America. I also drive to the TH and  drink all their beers too. I have not had Pliney The Younger so I can't comment on that, but it's only in a keg form and can't get the CA to try it. I have had Pliney the Elder though. Heady, as it's affectionately called, when fresh, far exceeds anything in its class. I have had many of the Tree house beers, and they are really good and deserve spots on the list but no IPA or DIPA from TH is as good as Heady. King Julius is close. I have both Heady and TH beers in my frig at all times and enjoy them all. I wont comment on what I taste or how it pours because it's different for most people. Find someone that has fresh heady and trade with them and you will see why a large majority of people think it's the best they ever had."
"Heady Topper","Can Date: purchased 10/14/16"
"Heady Topper","So I did half of Focal from a Can and half from glass, as a result I did the whole of Heady from the Can."
"Heady Topper","Pours a five finger white head that fades slowly to a ring leaving a good lace. Hazy light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied.  Pine hop nose and flavor is pine and grapefruit, occasional hints of caramel. Lingering pine hop bitterness. With most raters saying this DIPA is the best I expected more. Dogfish 90 minute is better. $15.03 for a 4-pak of 16oz cans from Montpelier Discount Beverage Montpelier, VT."
"Heady Topper","Crawl into the can!"
"Heady Topper","Acquired in a trade.  I was told the canned date was 10/8.  I have a hard time believing this with the lack of hop aroma and taste.  I could speculate what it'd be like fresh as I've had many fresh IPAs and IPAs past their prime.  Rating this off of the told canned date.  Doesn't hold up well at all if the canned date is 10/8.  Smell and taste of fresh hop aromas was non-existent.  Malty flavor, tasted like an old IPA."
"Heady Topper","So, when a friend offered to sell me 12 fresh cans at face price, I had to jump on it.  I was surprised to see the disclaimer on the can that encouraged one to drink it directly from the can.  I'm actually a fan of that practice.  Overall, this beer is very well-balanced.  It's excellent.  I would drink it again.  I probably wouldn't drive 12 hours to get it though.  Not sure I understand how this is #6 on the all time list.  "
"Heady Topper","Unknown vintage; drank 2/7/15 @ California Split. "
"Heady Topper","Citrusy, herbal, hoppy flavor.  FULL of hops, in both it's aroma and flavor.  Behind the citrusy, bitter, grassy, herbal, dank hops, it has notes of pear and light tropical fruit.  Creamy, almost foamy mouthfeel.  It was a great tasting, enjoyable beer, but with all the great IPA's out there, I don't see exactly what sets this one so far above the rest."
"Heady Topper","Had this at Manhattan Pizza in Burlington from a can. "
"Heady Topper","Orange! Smells sweet and piney and fresh. Taste is sweet grapefruit and herbal, resinous, mild bitterness on the back end, very smooth. Lighter bodied and moderate carbonation"
"Heady Topper","This is a phenomenal IPA, but falls short of all of the hype it receives in my opinion.  Each time I have had it, I am expecting to be completely wow'd, however, it ends up being just a beer that I greatly enjoy drinking."
"Heady Topper","Waited in a gas station convenience store in the middle of nowhere Vermont on a Wednesday afternoon in a line that was 50 people deep to get one case of this stuff.  Let me tell you, worth the wait and it lives up to all the hype.  I've had a lot of hoppy IPAs, but this is unique and the only way I can describe it is that it is very floral.  You immediately smell the hops, like you took a big handful of the freshest hops and crushed it up in your hands and stuffed your nose in it.  The taste matches it, very floral and bright, but not too bitter in the back.  Smooth finish and makes you crave more.  Guess I'm going to have to head back up to the middle of nowhere Vermont to get some more as soon as it's gone, definitely worth it."
"Heady Topper","Appearance:  Hazy cloud of dark lemon yellow to orange with a generous two fat fingers of fluffy white head and plenty of lacing and retention is amazing dissipates like a giant tortoise makes love."
"Heady Topper","1 for look since it has to be drank from the can I wasn't allowed to look! ;)"
"Heady Topper","Drank out of the can outside ohare international airport with the love of my life on our way to Vegas baby! A little bitter/hoppy for my palate but I understand the hype. Not as juicy as I thought it would be but still enjoyable."
"Heady Topper","Taste is too strong.   Wouldn't want any more than 1"
"Heady Topper","Pours - Cloudy orange color super thick foamy white head with tons of lacing."
"Heady Topper","I had Heady several times.  I do think it is a really good beer, don't get me wrong. It is a world class beer.  It is by far the best beer that Alchemist brewery has to offer.  I just feel like there are a lot of beers in New England that gives heady a run for its money without the hassle of trying to get your hands on it."
"Heady Topper","This is an exquisite fresh beer!  I like to have just one and then switch to a different brew."
"Heady Topper","It was a few weeks ago so I won't get too specific here in terms of looks smell taste feel, but this is an amazing beer. I have been searching for it for a long time, and a friend came through for me. The can I had was probably a little older than it ideally should have been, if that had not been the case I may have to go 5 on this... hard to imagine a better beer of this style."
"Heady Topper","Honey, lemon juice, cloudy in texture with little visible carbonation.  Topped with 3 fingers of white, foamy head."
"Heady Topper","Last Friday and Saturday I visited the new brewery/tasting room/sales center in Waterbury and enjoyed HT on tap, and, subsequently, poured into a standard pint glass and then, as recommended, directly from the can. Try it for yourself, but I thought it tasted much better in a glass, where the wonderful blend of hops opened up. We were in NE for a wedding, and the extra ten hours we drove to partake and purchase were well rewarded. The wait was not bad on Friday, but there was a longer line on Saturday. Sufficient product was available both days."
"Heady Topper","Great IPA but not as good as focal banger or other new england ipas"
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can"
"Heady Topper","From last night."
"Heady Topper","Gave it a 5 for looks, simply because I wasn't going to give it less when I have no idea what it looks like since I drink it from the can as instructed."
"Heady Topper","Great beer! My heart still lies with Treehouse but this beer is incredible!"
"Heady Topper","Fantastic. My Top 5 beers of all time"
"Heady Topper","Awesome taste from the first sip to the last."
"Heady Topper",.
"Heady Topper","Finally got the chance to try Heady courtesy of a buddy who shipped me a can. Probably 2+ months old, poured into a tulip glass. Look is a golden-straw color, slightly hazy, well carbonated, with a fluffy white head that holds well and laces gently. Smell is initially fairly subdued, with grapefruit rind and citrus, dank, dank grassiness, light biscuit, sweet tropical fruit, and a little onion. As the beer warms those aromas intensify greatly and wonderfully, especially the sweet tropical fruit and dankness. Taste is honestly more mellowed than I expected. Definitely juicy and fruity and citrusy, but not really uniquely so. But so damn drinkable. Soft bitterness, grassy herbalness, and light biscuit to go along with the citrus and tropical fruitiness. Goes down so damn easy. Feel is fuller than it looks, quite silky and luscious. Really wonderful beer.  The hype would be hard for any beer to live up to, especially one that is intended to be extra-crushable. Certainly will drink it any time I can, and will continue to seek out opportunities for it, but not sure I would say it's the best IIPA I've ever had in a world where many brewers are pushing the sensory envelope. But man I wish I had easier access to it, because this is one you'd love to have on hand at all times."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 of can into a tulip glass. "
"Heady Topper","L: murky hazy orange. Big head and retention."
"Heady Topper","Tasty treat from Bennington Vt."
"Heady Topper","Loved it!  Had the opportunity to share with some friends that have tried every IPA. They all said it is fantastic. Taste is great. Drinking out of the can works as well as in a glass. This one will not dissapoint."
"Heady Topper","L - Hazy orange with two fingers of white head"
"Heady Topper","Best beer I have ever had as 2015."
"Heady Topper","Rarely if ever had a beer with such aroma from a can that it permeates the entire space. That being said, that is the best part about this beer. Too sweet, alcohol is quite present, and has a lingering bitterness that some people love but I find overwhelming. Still great but not worth the hype. Focal Banger is more deserving of this."
"Heady Topper","I was pretty excited to try this beer after hearing so much about it. It was a very good beer but it was not my favorite double IPA."
"Heady Topper","Clearly, the best beer ever brewed.  Love it!  First tried it in the Burlington Airport.  Friends talked me into trying it.  I thought, well, it is another beer.  News flash: It is not any other beer, but the best beer.  The hops seem to wrap around your brain and you float away to another world."
"Heady Topper","For me, just a perfectly balanced IPA. Fresh, herbal, piney, just enough citrus, crisp, but soft enough to be juicy. Love it all around, and one of those beers that deserves the hype. That being said, I'll probably very rarely drink it unless I happen to be in Vermont and happen to be at some place that actually has it- and that's okay. As good as it is, just drink fresh and local when it comes to IPAs- there are plenty of amazing, or at least very solid ones out there, and all over the place."
"Heady Topper","with all the hype usually most things disappoint the Topper does not. the beer is a must try."
"Heady Topper","I liked the beer, but did not think that the taste was enough different than many others to get such a great review. But I will take a case of them at any time!!"
"Heady Topper","Do believe the hype, but the difficulty of getting ahold of some (having to stake out stores or plan your day around procuring a 4-pack) gets frustrating."
"Heady Topper","Just what the world has been waiting for: another Heady review..."
"Heady Topper","appearance- Golden in color with a slight amber hue, hazy bordering on turbid, and pours a fizzy two inch head."
"Heady Topper","I was lucky enough to pick up 8 of these on a trip through Vermont.  Gotta give it a perfect 5 because it's the best beer I've ever tasted & now the beer to which I compare all PAs upon tasting.  When you open the can, you get hit with a citrus/pine aroma hop blast even if you're not all that up close that is refreshing all on its own even before tasting.  Then put in a mouthful & let the full hop taste cover your tongue & hit you with citrus/melon/pine/dank flavours before fading to a faint bitterness that is pleasant, unlike many IPAs, so much so that I hesitate to use the word bitterness.  I've had 5 now & switched to drinking from the can as per instructions.  Even though I think it's all in my head, it's tasting even better that way.  My favourite way to savour one of these: Open at around 8C or a few degrees above fridge temperature.  Open outside on a nice hot day & enjoy the aroma & the fantastic flavour of the first few sips.  Then, jiggle it up a bit to let a bit of the carbonation subside & enjoy the increased smoothness & slightly altered flavours for the 2nd half of the can.  Beer heaven!"
"Heady Topper","So this is supposed to be the Holy Grail of beer! I'm drinking from the can first like it says to. As you open the can you can smell sweet hops, very fruity but then comes the pine. Exactly what you'd expect from such a hyped beer. Took the first few sips from the can and its hard to explain how good this beer is. I will fall into the category of people who may overhype this beer but it was delicious! I feel it taste better when poured into a good IPA glass. I will be making trips to Vermont any chance I get to have this and anything else The Alchemist have to offer."
"Heady Topper","The starting point for all NE hazy IPAs, this and Tree House changed my perspective on beer.  "
"Heady Topper","Over Rated! Good beer not a 100 I live here and dont understand the hype. Many many beers equal to or much better that are not rated so high.."
"Heady Topper","Drank majority out of the can.  Poured a bit into a tulip for look and because I usually drink out of a tulip."
"Heady Topper","I have never had a better balanced beer of any style. This is quite simply, incredible! Thanks to Mr Kennedy for sourcing it!"
"Heady Topper","Drank out of can as instructed by can, sooo, look was irrelevant. Citrus, specifically papaya on the nose, giving way to mellow, smooth finish. Yum."
"Heady Topper","After years of hearing all the hype about this brew, and wondering if I'd ever get the chance to try it without making a special trip to Vermont, I finally hold a can of this ""whale"" in my hand. I'd like to give a special thanks to Jason for this amazing gift. My excitement is mounting, time to crack it open... "
"Heady Topper","Finally got a hold of one after many years of longing...it was delicious no doubt, but not life-altering as I expected.  The aroma is killer: fresh cut grass, grapefruit, hit you immediately and you know you have something really good.  Finishes with a mild bitterness that stays on the tongue but not obtrusively.  You'd never know it's 8% based on taste."
"Heady Topper","I really wanted to love this beer, but to me it was just ok"
"Heady Topper","So much hype, but almost worth it. An amazing beer - certainly one of the best I've ever had. Not sure I'd wait in long lines for a 4-pack, but I'd also never turn one down!"
"Heady Topper","I've had this beer a number of times and most recently at a restaurant serving it in the Burlington area.  IMO, it is still an outstanding beer, but in this one can I drank it seemed different - thinner, less of a mouth feel to it along with fainter smell and taste.  I believe the increase in production over the past few years may have something to do with it or possibly it was an off can or even my own taste buds changing.  Still wouldn't pass on a 4-pack though!"
"Heady Topper","I just tasted Heady Topper from the can as instructed. Hop aroma of citrus, piney and some dank. Tastes explodes with carbonation bitterness. This dies down and the hop flavors explode, peach, mango and grapefruit. WOW ! ! ! What just happened ?  Another taste and WOW ! ! ! ! ! "
"Heady Topper","Poured from can into glass. Golden honey color with minimal head and medium bubbles. Smells of bitter citrus but with something a little off. Mouth feel is slightly syrupy. Tastes like a hoppy fresh cranberry and a little malty."
"Heady Topper","Great dipa. Not 'juicy' like some other northeast dipas but nice thick hop taste.  Has a pleasant bite to it."
"Heady Topper","This is the beer that i base other other beers upon.  I may be a touch bias, i live 3 hours from Burlington and can get this beer semi regularly if needed.  but, for the money this thing is the benchmark of everything else and until something else hits my lips this is my unicorn."
"Heady Topper","Good but Focal Bamger is better :)"
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed straight from the can as directed. Not sure on the date, but I know it was canned over a month ago."
"Heady Topper","This is the best beer I have had the pleasure of drinking. The aroma was thick with hoppy goodness. First drink did not carry as much hop flavor as the nose indicates, but that is okay. No bitterness whatever with this beer. There are no other adjectives that I can assign....all I can say is this is what all IPAs should aspire to be."
"Heady Topper","Had this about a year ago, can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  Pour is a golden, nearing straw yellow hue. Frothy tight white bubbled head, excellent lacing on the glass. With the aroma, I have no other way to explain it other than the perfect array of hops. A certain dankness in the back end, back door with a tropical sweetness of mangos, pinneapple, guava. No maltiness detected. Taste follows the nose well, with a burst of tropical resinous hops, even a funky yeast presence with a burst of piney, palate coating goodness. Pretty much the perfect IPA, nothing gimmicky or typical ""NE hazy""-like. It's in its own lane, and deserves every bit of hype."
"Heady Topper","The mighty Heady Topper! Been drinking it for years now. Finally reviewing it. Golden yellow in appearance. Haze for days. Smells like a combination of grapefruit, freshly cut grass, and pine. Taste mostly follows the nose. The finish is incredible. The leftover hop flavors that cling to your tongue are delightful without over doing it. "
"Heady Topper","Can from Lee"
"Heady Topper","What a treat to drink a beer like Heady Topper that lives up to it's reputation.  Imperial IPA's are my favorite style so I have had plenty and this has to be a top 3.   If you ever have the opportunity to drink one of these bad boys don't pass it up."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is by far my overall favorite. Its been a while since I have actually looked at the color since I drink Heady directly from the can when I can. I live in Florida and Vacation during the summer in Vermont I highly recommend the whole immersive cultural experience of getting Heady Topper fresh by any means possible which may include stalking the beer truck on delivery day, or waiting online at one of the delivery locations in close proximity to their brewery in Waterbury Vermont.  Upon popping open a Heady Topper the smell is intense and Hoppy as is the taste, there is a slight bitterness with your first sip which dissipates quickly leaving your palate yearning for more.   With balanced carbonation the mouth feel is that of pure refreshment."
"Heady Topper","I live in Vermont and have had Heady Topper many times, mostly when its the only thing to drink at a party. I remember the first time, I gagged and I thought that someone had given me a beer and spiked it with fresh cut grass clippings. I know I'm in the minority up here but I'm tried of all the craft breweries trying to cram as many hops as they can into a can of beer."
"Heady Topper","Truly exceptional!"
"Heady Topper","Perfection in a can."
"Heady Topper","Consumed both fresh from the can and poured into a tulip glass. Review is based on from the can, which was the superior tasting experience."
"Heady Topper","The Alchemist ""Heady Topper"""
"Heady Topper","Great all around beer... Only gets better from here."
"Heady Topper","DRINK FROM THE CAN!"
"Heady Topper","Best dipa I've ever had"
"Heady Topper","OMG!!!   Love this beer and thank god I have a friend in Burlington that can get it to me here in Florida and Maine.  I've got about 1/2 of a case in my beer fridge right now and I'm nurturing it along.  So easy to drink. TOO damn easy to drink actually.  I've even lined up an hour early (with about 75 people in front of me) at the Winooski Warehouse for, as it turned out a half case) of FRESH Heady.  Happy to get that."
"Heady Topper","Had this many times but nothing compares to being in Vermont and the truck pulls up and the parade of hand trucks goes into the Craft Beer Cellar in Waterbury. Mouth dropped! Taste way different then ones I had back home, that where muled from Vermont. Drink from the CAN!"
"Heady Topper","Excellent, very hopped with a long, smooth ending."
"Heady Topper","Lived up to the hype, for real.  "
"Heady Topper","Updated 8/9/16; consumed from a can picked up same day from new brewery."
"Heady Topper","Perfect IPA"
"Heady Topper","Had it shipped to Colorado just to taste this icon of an IPA and boy howdy!"
"Heady Topper","Drank out of the can, so no 'look' rating here. Heavy heavy hops, thick mouthfeel and lots of malt. Overall hop flavor is not super juicy or aromatic like a Julius or PseudoSue, but great quality nonetheless."
"Heady Topper","Best DIPA I've ever had. Fuss warranted."
"Heady Topper","Hopefully the new brewery will make it easier to get."
"Heady Topper","A favorite with nice hoppiness and citrus flavors. Never saw color as drank from the can."
"Heady Topper",Overrated
"Heady Topper","Look: Amber. Mostly translucent but a slight haze; 20% opacity. Little creamy head; most dissipated fairly quickly but held at the rim throughout the drink. "
"Heady Topper","Thick, smells like hops, and tastes like heaven."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass from a 16.9oz can"
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper lived up to its name. A very well mad beer that has a strong punch. I'm glad that I tried this beer and look forward to enjoying it again."
"Heady Topper","L: hazy, straw"
"Heady Topper","One of the best DIPA!!  My only complaint is having to drive 2hrs to get and there have been times it was sold out.  When will this be distributed in NH???"
"Heady Topper","By far my second favorite IPA of all time, only slightly outclassed by Sip of Sunshine. This beer will forever held a dear place in my gut. <3"
"Heady Topper","Smell: tropical fruit notes grapefruit orange pine floral grassy."
"Heady Topper","I never liked IPA's until I had a Heady.  Now, I'll never go back to flat tasteless beers.  This beer is just bursting with fresh hoppy goodness, there is nothing like it."
"Heady Topper","If you can get your hands on this beer. Get it and keep it."
"Heady Topper","Says ""Drink from the can"" so I did, but I also poured my next one, floral, citrus armoa, taste again is very earthy like, super bitter. Looking forward to comparing with Pliny the Elder but I feel like I will still prefer heady."
"Heady Topper","Tasted from a 16 oz can on May 29, 2016.  Look is unknown.  Smell is hoppy with ester, herb, mint and orange aromas.  Taste is bitter citrus, hop oil and orange with some sweet malt flavors.  Feel is medium in body with a bitter and somewhat dry finish."
"Heady Topper","Just not my style."
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from the can--just superb in all the sense, the mouthfeel was rich and creamy. The perceived bitterness was immediately countered by the incredible mouthfeel, completely relaxed my palate and left me totally satisfied."
"Heady Topper","Without question the best IPA that I've ever had."
"Heady Topper","What's left to say that hasn't already been said? Just an incredible drinking experience."
"Heady Topper","the best IPA I never taste for me thank you for make it ."
"Heady Topper","A solid IPA for sure, but definitely not a top 5 beer.  Had this as fresh as you could get it (and numerous subsequently) and never found this to be anything special.  If I end in VT again, I will definitely drink it, but will not go out of my way to seek it out."
"Heady Topper","Drank from can and glass.  Under week old."
"Heady Topper","The look of this beer is very nice, a slightly hazy yellow wheat in color with a full white head. The smell is amazing, fruity, citrus, lemon peel. The taste is even better. Starting with the fruity and citrus flavor and ending with a little more bitter pine flavor. Definitely not overly bitter for my palate and it hangs on the tongue for the perfect finish. Mouth feel is very close to perfection and extremely smooth. Overall this is one of the greatest IPAs out there. It still holds its own against the newer ""juicy"" style of IPA. It is a must try for any beer lover."
"Heady Topper","Yep, I cheated and poured 1 of my 4 cans into glasses."
"Heady Topper","So I tested this, julius, haze, and SOS at the same time and these were the results (with all being canned within 7 days of each other)"
"Heady Topper","Only a couple days old, poured into a pint glass. Cloudy with about an inch of white. This is the best smelling beer ever. Flowers, cut grass/pine, citrus. Substantial mouthfeel without being syrupy. Extremely well-balanced hop/malt profile. Extremely well-done."
"Heady Topper","I've had it both in the can and in a glass.  For a review I guess I need at least a bit of a look....it has a nice yellow haze with a decent head.   Aroma from the can, however, is truly outstanding.  Fresh hops, perfectly balanced betweeb pine and citrus.    Flavor has a nice bite that leans more towards the bitterness end of a hop flavor profile.  Wish there was just a little more malt, but then it would probably be even higher in alcohol.  Mouthfeel a little cloying....and I mean little. But why complain?  This is a great beer, thoroughly enjoyable, and well worth the hype.  So many great IPAs, so little time."
"Heady Topper","Classic for a reason.  Lots of fruit showing, and juicy mouthfeel.  It is worth tracking this one down.  Had it from the can, as advised to do. Slightly cloudy orangey color.  Not quite as hoppy as Focal Banger."
"Heady Topper","Pint can. Poured most into a tulip, had a little from the can as per the instructions. Paired with Maine potato vegetable soup, Vermont sharp cheddar, and some crusty bread with garlic."
"Heady Topper","Well done, but a bit more resinous than I prefer"
"Heady Topper","Overrated. Ommegang's Nirvana and Long Trail's Limbo are much better IPAs and they don't require you to drink them ""in the can"" to taste good."
"Heady Topper","Surprising flavor will buy again!!"
"Heady Topper","Traded a Hipster Brunch for a can. Simply put, best IPA I've ever had"
"Heady Topper","Another all hype beer in my opinion. Do t get me wrong, it's a tasty beer and not your typical malt forward East Coast IPA but I was left wanting more. More body, more aroma, more hop flavors, he'll even more bitter hops. It all seemed a little muted to me. I'll definately try it again, maybe mine were older or didn't ship well?"
"Heady Topper","Drank during a blind taste test with other top notch beers. Very solid IPA, but doesn't live up to the hype IMO. Pours light gold color with not much head. Very crisp and smooth."
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from the 16oz can (no date) at 48°F. Consumed on 05May16."
"Heady Topper","One of the best IPA's I've had.  Those Trillium brews have really skewed me on what is THE BEST though.  Great look and aroma and awesome blend of citrus with a piney bite.  Nice blend of new wave hazy and flavor of traditional standard.  Got much better as it warmed up."
"Heady Topper","Hoppy citrus aroma. Hoppy start, citrus, pineapple almost a light pineapple. Very complex yet sooooo smooth. Exceptional well made.  Light pepper finish."
"Heady Topper","had about 10 cans of topper over the last year or two.  "
"Heady Topper","im finally in possession of one of these again.   used to live off this stuff when brewery was allowing no limits.   I poured this and did not drink from the can.  after I let the floaties settle I notice nice hazy light orange with minimal head retention.  nice fresh nose of orange rind and tangerine.  taste follows nose with up front grapefruit and pineapple with some pine floating around somewhere.  mouth is a little thin but does not retract from the beer. the initial taste is  followed by a surprising increase in flavor that creams your palate and works all the way to the end with dry finish.  this beer is phenominal and has tons of flavor from start to finish.   bright citrisy notes are abundant and my mouth puckers as the beer goes down.   im drinking this after doppleganger from treehouse and dopple gets the nod.  heady may not be what I remember it to be but still a world class beer that is worthy of the hype."
"Heady Topper","Pours a  very murky pale gold in color with a billowing frothy white head that seems to hang on forever. A significant amount of lacing on the glass. Very pleasing to the eye."
"Heady Topper","Had out of a can at Cold Hollow Cider Mill in Waterbury, VT. Drank out of the can but I poured some into a cup to get a better look at the beer. The beer had this medium tone yellow appearance with great retention. Aromas were great with this slightly cooked pine and orange peel with a citrus balance that was really mouth watering. Taste follows the nose with this sharp hoppy flavor mixed with citrus of mostly orange and grapefruit. Excellent carbonation to this beer, which makes it really drinkable. Overall, a really good DIPA."
"Heady Topper","Great taste"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can so I can't say much about how it looked other than it was deep golden in color.  Aromas of pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange.  Tastes absolutely incredible and follows the aroma perfectly,  very slightly bitter and a slight floral presence.  Medium bodied and carbonated.  It took me a very long time to find my first can, hoping it wont take nearly as long to find more."
"Heady Topper","Everything the hype lead it to be. Amazing beer"
"Heady Topper","Appearance: You should definitely drink this out of the can."
"Heady Topper","Deep Gold in color and cloudy with little head and no lacing."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: pours a hazy golden yellow color with a 1"" head that falls to a thick surface covering. Mild lace develops during the session."
"Heady Topper","Gotta drink it fresh! Would drive 10 hours to Vermont just to get some."
"Heady Topper","Harder to get every year but always worth getting. Easily one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Aroma is wonderful. Taste is unbeatable. Love this beer."
"Heady Topper","The hype is justified with this one."
"Heady Topper","Yes!!  Just say yes to Heady"
"Heady Topper","Lives up to the hype"
"Heady Topper","Against the wishes of the brewers, this comes out of the can a very light creamy yellow, but then darkens in the glass to a partially opaque yellow orange. The carbo-pillar in the center is still visible, supporting the large foam head well. Heady Topper retains an unbelievably soft, fluffy thin blanket, with spotty fluid lacing throughout."
"Heady Topper","This is one of the best DIPAs on the planet. We first experienced this at the brewery, when it was open to the public. On tap, it is unbeatable and in a can still one of the finest."
"Heady Topper","Almost perfect"
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is a world class IPA. Although the turbidity isn't as strong as Hill Farmstead or Tree House, Heady is somewhat translucent yellow. I smell some oranges, grapefruit, and lemons. The taste has some medium bitterness up front with a slightly tart, lemony note following. The taste hits early on and falls off rather quickly and cleanly for great drinkability for 8% abv. Overall, fabulous beer. Nevertheless, I think Julius surpasses Heady due to its creaminess."
"Heady Topper","Not really an IPA guy but this is really good! Crisp, good mouthfeel, a lot of fruity flavors and clean finish! Highly recommended!"
"Heady Topper","Drank half from the can and half from a snifter.  I prefer it from the glass.  "
"Heady Topper","Had the first sip out of the can because I can't completely ignore directions.  Tons of grapefruit.  It pours cloudy with nice head which doesn't linger very long or leave a ton of lacing.  No hop chunks in this can.  Smell is very good but it didn't fully live up to my very high expectations.  Taste is great and easily one of the best DIPAs I've had with the bitterness only coming in hard in the aftertaste.  Crazy drinkable at 8%.  That said, I'm still not sure it lived up to my expectations since I definitely prefer some much easier to get IPAs."
"Heady Topper","Right place right time. Randomly at the J Wakefield Brewery in Miami by the house just doing a flight of some of their delicious offerings when a Heady Topper emerges from the back room. Apparently a friend of a friend dropped some off to the staff and I was lucky enough to snag a nip. Sharp is the word that comes to mind. If this IPA was a person it would be well dressed in an Armani suit. Clean and crisp, sessionable if you can come across enough of them. 8% feels like 4%. Excellente."
"Heady Topper","Pours yellow, hazy with a very nice white foam head (I poured it to share it, even though it says it´s better from the can). Aroma is great, hoppy, citric, flowery, fruity, delicious. Taste is amazing, hops and malts are very well balanced and tasty. Amazing beer, getting one of these in Mexico is nearly impossible. Cheers"
"Heady Topper","Exceptional beer!"
"Heady Topper","Heady is one of those beers that I heard nothing but hype about for years before I finally ever tried it.  I can comfortably say that it's fantastic, and that it by no means lands anywhere in my personal top beers.  Aroma is an orange grove. Flavor is a forest of zesty hops and fluffy citrus. Surprisingly, to me, drinking it from the can is better than pouring into a glass. A world-class beer that might have amazed me more if I had tasted it a long time ago."
"Heady Topper","Big, bright, hop bomb. I've had it many times and each time I tend to feel the same way. It's not my favorite IPA (or even in the top 5 - I tend to lean more toward piney IPAs) but I do really enjoy the brightness and the fruit, especially in the nose."
"Heady Topper","My cousin from Maine from Maine brought me home a can of this.   Wow this is one of the smoothest IPAs ever had.  Nice Pinny taste can taste the floral hops.  One big plus, it comes in a can."
"Heady Topper","Damn. Thus is quite a good ipa. It's hard to go in with an open mind. I, honestly, think that I was trying to under rate it to off set my inherent bias, but i kept going back for more and more. It is quite unique and delicious. Here goes:"
"Heady Topper","Don't want to be to technical with reviews so here goes MY take on this beer."
"Heady Topper","I don't know how a beer could be more perfect. "
"Heady Topper","This is by far the best of the best. I've been looking for a beer to top this, but have yet to find it. I beleive all the hype, and know that this is worth making the trip. The BROS' review is an understatement, you must try this beer."
"Heady Topper","Poured from 16 oz can into snifter. No visible date but was told this was canned about 5 weeks ago. "
"Heady Topper","so glad i tracked a can down. Orange looking with a very nice tropical fruit aroma. Taste was bitter up front, then into those subtle fruity tones with a dry finish, but it actually improved as it warmed and became very drinkable and enjoyable towards its end. Unfortunately for heady, there are now far better and more accessible Ipa's around (see Finback, LIC and other half).best beer in the world?no chance. Enjoyable though and glad i got to try it."
"Heady Topper","I enjoyed this beer, not as much as I thought I was going to. Very hyped for what I thought was just a nice Double IPA. Was this beer the best DIPA 8 years ago, probably. Not anymore. So many great beers out there. "
"Heady Topper","the beast. this ones really hard to review. smell is so complex, tropical here, piney there, fruity over there, citrusy under there. malt? what malt? taste is even more complex than the smell. just about every hop taste there is, all over a juicy fuzzy bed. this one is killer. need to get my hands on focal and more of this!"
"Heady Topper","L-Hazy naval orange flesh color. White fluffy head."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Very light and cloudy. Straw colored murky beer with particles floating around."
"Heady Topper","Love this beer"
"Heady Topper","Cans shared at the Craft Beer Co., London, many thanks to Mike. This stuff is totally rad. Out of academic interest I poured a small amount into my glass to find that this liquid is cloudy, glowing gold with a small, white foam head. Otherwise, slammed it straight to my face. Heady as shit, big and resinous, though not too big, or abrasively bitter. Huge pine character, ridiculously well balanced. Full bodied with fine carbonation. Big sticky finish, moderate earth. Just outrageous stuff."
"Heady Topper","Best ipa I've ever had excellent beer"
"Heady Topper","Let me say that my usual preference is a West Coast IPA. However, it is really nice to be able to explore the complexities of the hops without all the fruit. The earthy pine taste really comes through. While complex, the taste is balanced and the inevitable blast of hoppiness is very pleasant."
"Heady Topper","Beer review number 1000. Lucked out getting this. Sometimes the stars align...drank half from the can and poured half into a snifter."
"Heady Topper","Did not drink from a can. Large tulip SARA glass."
"Heady Topper","I can't believe this finally happened.  Snagged a partial can at The Site in Corning.  Poured into a sample glass."
"Heady Topper","The first few times I had Heady Topper, it was love at first, second, third, and fourth taste.  Since then, I've become hyper-critical (but that often stems from boredom).  The feel of the Heady is my favorite part, a creaminess with bite that just reminds you with every taste that you are taking in something of such high quality that you feel almost blasphemous drinking it out of a can.  I'd prefer the look to be a shade darker (but really, who cares), and the taste has just a touch too much bite on the front end to cry 'perfection'.  But perfection is an endless pursuit, and since Heady is probably the best beer I've ever had, it gets a 5 overall.  I love it and hopefully always will."
"Heady Topper","Had it out of a can at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury.  Poured a little into a taster just to check out the look, cloudy and straw colored.  A nice hoppy aroma, but more subtle, not a punch to the face like other doubles."
"Heady Topper","The beer has lived up to the hype for me.  It is a great drink all the way through the can.  We are a community of samplers, and this one is atop the list.  I don't have a bunch of foofy words and feelings about the hop and feel.  It is a great beer and I would have it again and again."
"Heady Topper","All right, got this as a Christmas present from my nephew and I am oh so grateful."
"Heady Topper","Stunning beer. Cloudy pale gold with a nice white head and moderate sticky lacing. The nose is grapefruit and pine with a sweet aroma in the back. The taste is amazing. Medium body, sweetness, citrus fruit and bitter pine. Really great beer."
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed in a can like it says on the can so my look I just gave a 4."
"Heady Topper","Don't believe the hype. Is it a good Imperial IPA? Yes? Is it worth all the hullabalo no. Is it the best? Not even close. Honestly don't understand the big  deal with this beer. There are many better imperial IPA's out there. I think it being hard to get adds to the mystique of it but honestly there are other Vermont beers that are just as good. Do I regret buying it? No because going to this store allowed me to select a bunch of other delicious choices."
"Heady Topper","Pours a rich orange with a nice white finger of foam. Smell is layers of citrus and some pine. Taste is similar. Super medium feel with just the right carbonation. Dry, somewhat bitter finish that sticks around. Like many IPAs, this one seems to change a lot depending on its age. The first time I had it it was light yellow and kind of tart. I think this one hits the sweet spot, as it's pretty amazing. As the can says, not the biggest beer, but the way it puts it all together is artful."
"Heady Topper","good beer but overrated"
"Heady Topper","Had this sent from a friend up north and they did a number on the box which obviously gave me some questions to if it was  altered or not....as soon as I opened the can the smell was amazing and I was excited to see what all the hype was about.  Like so many say, a little hazy with a one finger head, amazing smell.  Love the citrus flavor, too many IPAs go way to Malty for me.  Love this brew, lives up to the hype!"
"Heady Topper","I know! ""Drink From The Can!"" they say... but I HAD to pour a small amount to a sniffer :)"
"Heady Topper","Pours cloudy and bright radiant gold with huge 3-finger head that eventually settles to 1. Sticky and bubbly lacing remains along the top and sides of the glass. (Yea, didn't drink from the can... but wanted to be able to look at it)."
"Heady Topper","Bright golden color, 2 inches of clean white foam."
"Heady Topper","A- Lightly cloudy, straw color. Thin white foamy head leaving little lacing."
"Heady Topper","I see why people go nuts for this beer. The smell hits ya but isn't too much. It moves like a fresh bit of flowers. Nice straw/golden color with a bit of haze. Very nice taste...crisp with a bit of bitterness and bite. It is one of the better beers I have ever had. Would certainly like to give it another go"
"Heady Topper","From the can.  Wonderful complexity in the taste profile - so much citrus flavor and aroma (especially grapefruit) in the beginning, then the sweet/bitter hoppy taste as the sip goes down. When fresh, this, in my opinion, is the epitome of Double IPA VT. beers."
"Heady Topper","Super juicy. Great bitterness and citrus balance.  Crisp and snappy. A little sharp through the end."
"Heady Topper","Poured from can into spiegelau ipa glass.  Nice 3 finger head which turns into a sea of foam.  Nice lacing.  Hazy yellow in appearance.  Smells great, picking up pine and citrus.  This beer is great, picking up pine and grapefruit on the taste.  Nice malt in the beginning with a slight bitter finish.  What lingers on my palate after taking a sip is the grapefruit.  Not bad.  I thank my daughter for rooming with someone on the East Coast and bringing this to me.  Great beer, but sad that I don't have constant access to it"
"Heady Topper","Most excellent, but more of an IPA than. Double."
"Heady Topper","The beer that changed beer drinking for me. This is by far my favorite beer. Complex hop flavors that hit you over and over! I can't get enough of it! Every time I crack one open its like the gates of Heaven are opening for me, while simultaneously my scalp is exploding off the top of my head. Delicious!! Quite difficult to come by, luckily my Grandma lives in Vermont and is able to get a ""somewhat"" steady supply to me.  Salud!!"
"Heady Topper","yum...what a fantastic beer that totally lives up to the hype! The first time I had it in the can at a bar and found the whole experience rather odd. I finally picked up a few more cans at a random line trade and had a chance to sit down and really enjoy what I consider to be one of the best beers in the world. "
"Heady Topper","One of my favorites"
"Heady Topper","Look: for the little bit that I did pour from the can, its hazy like the NE DIPAs, but its a little ugly"
"Heady Topper","Received a four pack as a surprise from my wife as an early Valentine's Day present so my ratings might be a little eschewed going up as simply put, how could one not enjoy trying this beer when they opened up the fridge and saw a surprise waiting for them (on Super Bowl Sunday no less)?  (I tried both from can and glass so my review is kind of a compare/contrast review of the two methods)"
"Heady Topper","Yeah it's a great beer, but..."
"Heady Topper","This beer lives up to the hype. I drank it from the can except for a small amount I poured into a Tumbler glass to check out the color and look etc. Straw yellow to gold, 1 finger of head with some lacing. A little carbonated looking. Smell was outstanding. Hops and citrus peel. Extra ripe mango, a little cannabis even. Taste was hoppy, spicy and a little bitter. Citrus and sweet very well balanced. Just outstanding. One of the best beers I have ever had. Mouthfeel was medium and the aftertaste is tart and bitter, in a good way. World class"
"Heady Topper","T-Epic pine. Forest floor. Fresh mountain water."
"Heady Topper","Pours deep gold with heavy haze.  Almost reminds me of pineapple juice though a shade darker.  1 finger off white head is sticky and fairly dense.  Leaves heavy lacing behind.  "
"Heady Topper","finally got my hands on a 4 pack of this. pretty much lived up to my  expectations. very well made beer. great smell when I opened the can. good color and great taste."
"Heady Topper","Flowery aroma, smooth finish, mild hoppy taste, well-rounded"
"Heady Topper","Look: hazy, pillowy head (poured into spieglau for sharing)"
"Heady Topper","A 1 pint can canned on 15th December 2015 (I would have drank it earlier but was very sick for a long period of time) and tried from the can at first then poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
"Heady Topper","My ""Gold Standard""."
"Heady Topper","Believe the hype. Heady Topper is the real deal."
"Heady Topper","A - okay, so from the can I'd give this a 5, the can is cool as hell. Also if I was thinking about the dank, pure, no censorship nature of this beer I'd give it a 5 too. But for fairness sake, it is a murky yellow/gold color with a  nice white head that sticks and leaves decent lacing. If any other beer looked like this id knock it for the look but this one it's just so fitting. "
"Heady Topper","I received two cans via trade. I was disappointed, perhaps the cans were old but don't know because they're not dated."
"Heady Topper","Worth all of the hype as it is my favorite beer I've had thus far. As many have said, I wish they actually distributed their product."
"Heady Topper","I gave ""look"" 5 cause I love the can haha.  I've never poured it out of the can, therefore have never seen it :)"
"Heady Topper","This beer changed DIPAs for me. Its Juicy, dank, and has the perfect amount of bitterness to balance out the malt profile. The 8% is well disguised behind layer after layer of tropical aroma and flavor. I definitely prefer the ""drink it from the can"" philosophy. Although I love the hop flavor, I find it unappealing to see the particulate floating in the glass."
"Heady Topper","This is the beer that started it all for me.  First hoppy beer I ever had where I was just blown away by the taste.  It is a great beer and I always try to share it with people to see if they will like it.  Great beer to get someone into craft beer with if you can find it.  Luckily I'm in the North east and have some access to it.  Love this beer my all time classic double IPA,  hop bomb!"
"Heady Topper","Luckily I was able to get 1. Believe the hype. This American IIPA is arguably the best overall in its class. "
"Heady Topper","This is one of my favorite beers since I most recently started drinking them. I've drunk about 8 of them in the past 5 months. I recommend this beer, it is the best NE IPA in the world."
"Heady Topper","Gold color, massive amounts of sediment throughout it, not turbidity, but rather a decent beer with chunks, rather than finer particulates uniformly dispersed throughout the beer.  "
"Heady Topper","Well worth the wait, being aself decribed non-IPA this was very drinkable beer. "
"Heady Topper","A- poured really hazy with a decent white head. Really hazy"
"Heady Topper","This beer changed my life.  I used to just drink beer.  Now I experience beer.  First time I had this it was like an explosion of hop flavor went off in my mouth.  I poured it into a glass contrary to the instructions on the can.  Flavors were like nothing I had ever experienced.  Such complex citrus, pine and malt flavors combined to produce a brew that is truly life changing."
"Heady Topper","In can"
"Heady Topper","With such hype and such high expectations, it seems inherent to grade this DIPA more critically and harsher than others. Even in doing so, this is an absolute one of a kind brew and the definition of a world class, perfectly balanced, hop explosion. An unreal drink. From aroma to taste to feel, it is truly unique and incredible. I am trying to compare it to pliny (elder) because I drink it so often and it has been my undisputed favorite imperial, but this is just so different that there is no way to compare. Both are as good as it gets and I cant wait to include Heady as a regular brew to mix up my usual pliny evenings. If you havnt had Heady, you need to."
"Heady Topper","A: Hazy cloudy golden yellow with foamy white head. I only poured a small amount out since its meant to drank right from the can"
"Heady Topper","Part of my Pliny vs Heady session"
"Heady Topper","Absolutely delightful double IPA.  Consumed directly from the can about two weeks old (unconfirmed).  The blast of hops in the mouthfeel after a fantastic nose was just unreal."
"Heady Topper","16 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and fairly creamy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely amazing DIPA style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A insanely delicious offering."
"Heady Topper","After hearing all the hype surrounding this one I finally got my hands on a case (less than a week old). Upon first opening the can I was immediately drawn in by the juicy aroma, after tasting I felt a little bit let down as in my mind THIS was THE BEER to try! The typical IPA notes are all there and in fact this was far smoother than most I have tried. In closing it's a great VT beer and definitely in my top 10 but is it the end all of beers? I don't think so."
"Heady Topper","The best beer in the world."
"Heady Topper","The best IPA that i've had.  Period.  Citrus and pine accompany the hops.  A very serious but not distracting malt backbone results in the most balanced ipa i've had.  Perfect."
"Heady Topper","Bought two cases up in Burlington, Vermont. The best IPA I've ever had. I prefer the taste of IPAs because of their huge flavor and hoppiness. One thing I'll tell you, you don't get the after taste of typical IPAs. You can drink this 8.0 ABV as a session beer.... You'll be passed out of you drink t as a session beer though. The unpasteurized canning feels like it's more potent than typical IPAs. I love it. Don't miss this one. Take the trip to Vermont."
"Heady Topper","Good beer not sayung anything bad about it, but to be ranked #5 its really overrated"
"Heady Topper","This is the beer that got me into hops. Honestly was under the belief that all IPAs were supposed to be so bitter and gross. It made me realize that I just had bad hoppy beers before. This is a Hop aroma bomb, this its got great balance between the massive hoppiness and malt backbone with little to no hope bitterness."
"Heady Topper","Always been an IPA fan. Amazing taste till the last drop in the can. Some IPAs tend to be too hoppy or bitter, but this one has the perfect balance. Listen to the words on the can and drink it straight out of the can. Really seals in the flavor. Made my Christmas in Vermont with or without the snow."
"Heady Topper","Love this brew every time I have one I need another to satisfy the craving!"
"Heady Topper","I had the priviledge to enjoy this all the way in Canada over Christmas. In brief, the beer was good, great even. But ... wait for it ... Pliny the Elder fresh from the source is THE #1 DIPA for me.  Meaning if I choose between one or the other - Pliny!!"
"Heady Topper","Massive thanks to Brandonhelvie for hooking me up with this long-time want! Time to pop that cherry now!"
"Heady Topper","Sets the standard for IPAs"
"Heady Topper","The overall taste and aroma from this beer is outstanding."
"Heady Topper","A great IPA to learn to appreciate others."
"Heady Topper","Bottle share (or can share) from redBeard. Beautiful aroma, heady indeed. Nice robust, slick body, hoppy notes dominate without distracting. Clean finish."
"Heady Topper","This was one of my favorite beers. I've only had one so far. Wish I could get them in cali. I had some from proper glassware and some from the can. Both amazing flavors, completely different tastes. I am in beer love!"
"Heady Topper","Straight from the can I get lots of hoppy aroma; citrus, grapefruit, some mango, and pine/resin. Taste is grapefruit with lots of slick resiny pine. Finish has a bit of alcohol but not out of line for the style. The slick hops knock down the body a bit but I'd still call it medium, moderate carbonation. "
"Heady Topper","This is an excellent IPA, and I'm acutely aware of its cult like status among beer aficionados - amplified because it's only available during a harvest moon of a leap year and only in Vermont (I kid...  mostly).  It is not the best I've ever had.  It's missing what I really appreciate from an IPA, which is bright and complex flavors.  It's well balanced, but that makes the fruit notes muted.  It's also loaded with hop resin which makes it rather unattractive (they tell you to drink it from the can).  As much as I love this, I would recommend ""Sip of Sunshine,"" by Lawson's Finest Liquids instead."
"Heady Topper","I tried this from the can first and then poured a second can into a pint glass in order to rate look. Got one finger of short-lived head but with lacing. Color was golden orange and murky, due to unfiltered nature. Actually looks much better than some would lead you to assume. Aroma from can was stronger compared to the glass; hops are giving me citrus, grapefruit, and pine notes.  Taste matches to perfection - I would call this a great juicy IPA. Nice, subdued bitterness on finish. Feel is definitely medium; a bit more body than many of the style. Nice carbonation. Overall, this one lives up to the hype."
"Heady Topper","Still really enjoy this piece of heaven, however the one I had on Christmas was not nearly as good as the first one , your first is always the best. thanks to family living in Burlington, can get it pretty regularly and fresh."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into a Chimay tuip."
"Heady Topper","My favorite DIPA of all time! I did not even know it existed until someone gave it to me for my 30th birthday, and then had it many more times on a vacation in Vermont. The way it tastes and the bitterness are just amazing."
"Heady Topper","The only reason I gave no perfect score is because the beer looks a bit cloudy. That's why it says to drink it from the can on the label. However, the hoppy smell and taste are one that has you saying ""that's good"" after the first sip. Then you have another sip and another and just keeps getting better. Delicious."
"Heady Topper","Truly outstanding"
"Heady Topper","A: cloudy; orangish gold in color; 2 finger ivory head that receded to a splotchy cap; nice lacing;"
"Heady Topper","Loved everything about this beauty besides the fact that it is not readily available in south Florida, or at least the last time I checked. I knew there was something exceptional about this slice of heaven because I basically asked for it in code and it was retrieved from the back as if we were back in the 20's in an undisclosed speakeasy. Maybe the rarity of this beer in south Florida warrants this hush hush conduct. Drank straight from the can so unable to see, smelled of hops, citrus perfect hops, tasted like more. I definitely did not get my fill of Heady Topper although some might argue my thirst is never quenched. Overall I loved it and it was perfect for me. Would not change a damn thing."
"Heady Topper","Finally got to try this over the holiday from a friend of a friend and drank from the can, as instructed.  By far one of the best DIPA I have gotten the pleasure to try. Hoppy, Citrusry... maybe I'm weird because I think the difference between this beer and say, Nightshift Santilli is not large, but I rate both extremely extremely highly."
"Heady Topper","Finally got a chance to try this (Thanks Will and Ian at Grapes and Gourmet for the sweet trade)."
"Heady Topper","Drank it both ways. From the can and in a glass (aroma is a big part my drinking experience and I was happy drinking from the glass. No surprise to the hype and cult iconic character. Well deserved. Did head to head with MBC Dinner, BB Swish and Foundation Epiphany. Personally I felt that Heady was a tad more on the bitter aspect. Nonetheless a solid solid DIPA."
"Heady Topper","Loved it"
"Heady Topper","Ok. Here I go. Got this from beerme330, big ups dude. Thank you. Drank it from the can other than a small amount poured to get a look at it. Looks like a floaty filled home brew. Smell was hops, tho they didn't eminate from the can as other have stated. Taste was quite hoppy with a bit of bitterness but it had an overwhelming booziness to it I didn't expect for 8%. Some citrus and tropical fruits present, but not nearly the life altering menagerie of lupulin I expected/hoped for. "
"Heady Topper","Simply put....delish."
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can as instructed on the can."
"Heady Topper","I'm afraid the good reviews this beer gets are mostly  historical. It's hard to find and just a little unimaginative for 2015 IPAs"
"Heady Topper","Is this the greatest beer or WHAT! Love this beer!!!"
"Heady Topper","This was the best hoppy beer I ever tried, UNTIL I tried Tree House's hoppy beers."
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can as suggested. Poured a bit into a snifter just to see the beautiful orange color and there were definite floaters in there. Smelled incredible. A multitude of citrus notes with grapefruit seemingly the strongest. Tasted lighter than other DIPAS recently and got more piney notes as the beer warmed. Overall lived up to the hype"
"Heady Topper","so this is it.....been looking for you for some time, almost had you but missed by inches.  look was the yellow unfiltered look that the better IPA's possess, must admit I put some in a glass just to savor the look and feel. smell was exquisite and with loads of citrus and hops, taste was a differentiator and had the heady topper flavor all to itself (just what i had waited for) flavor was long - sophisticated and real, w hops and citrus and the feel was silky and smooth, did not feel or taste the Double IPA or alcohol level.  just pure goodness, hope to see you again!"
"Heady Topper","16 ounce can poured into a tulip glass "
"Heady Topper","This isn't the first time I've had this but continues to remind me why I come back for more. Not my favorite DIPA but always a classic."
"Heady Topper","I've bought into the hype full on.  At first, I wasn't sure this was a perfect IPA, but after a case...and a year later, I'm sold.  The grassy, dank hops wave that blasts you in the face with each sip, damn...just perfect."
"Heady Topper","Got one as a gift.  Opened it to celebrate my Patriots winning the Super Bowl.  It was worthy of the occasion."
"Heady Topper","It's good to be King!"
"Heady Topper","Pours a light gold, very hazy, medium head with lots of tiny bubbles. Aroma is rich with mint, ripe pear, some mixture of citrus, light pine, faint hint of earthiness. Interesting bitterness taste, light up front, then hits you a bit, then fades and lingers. Definitely a ""juicy"" VT IPA."
"Heady Topper","thanks to the beer advocate trading community...i've had this on several occasions!  The nose on this beer is incredibly citrus &  juicy and the taste does not disappoint.  No aftertaste.  Just a wonderfully crafted IPA."
"Heady Topper","L - Kate Upton in a glass. In other words, a 20-something babe who's voluptuous and will never look this good again. Yet, here's the difference: Heady Topper will always look this good because Alchemist has gone to great lengths to perfect this beer. Super turbid, excellent head retention and brilliant variations of orange when held to the light. Only poured to extract a true interpretation of the look. This isn't my first dance with Heady. Drink from the can!"
"Heady Topper","Probably the best smelling IPA I have ever come across.  Comparing to Pliny the Elder, Heady is more ""In your Face"".  The taste is bold and the Hops hit you all at once.  Its almost an overload, but that's a good thing.  Do drink it from the can as it tells you.  This deserves its spot amongst the best."
"Heady Topper","I have never had a better IPA."
"Heady Topper","Fortunate enough to have this at Hunahpu day '15. I'm not at all fond of IPA's in general, opposite of a hop head. But this one delivers! Fantastic fresh citrusy hop aroma! Taste follows aroma, very bright, fresh hop flavor, with  substantial but not overwhelming bitterness. Drinks light for an 8%. A phenomenal example of the style."
"Heady Topper","Consumed out the can "
"Heady Topper","16oz can into pint glass. "
"Heady Topper","This brew is as good as everyone says it is. On a recent trip to Burlington, VT I spent a good hour in hopes of finding some. I was able to score a 4pack in store and a single can with dinner on Church Street. This beer is the standard which all other IPA's are judged against nowadays, and with good reason."
"Heady Topper","Easy to see why this is the world's best IPA. Crisp, super hoppy, citrus and pine notes make for an interesting flavor profile. The aroma is out of this world. Traveling to Vermont for this beer makes for a truly unique experience. A must for any beer lover"
"Heady Topper",Perfection.
"Heady Topper",CAN
"Heady Topper","Aroma: pineapple, citrus, pine, little bit of onion"
"Heady Topper","Top class. Time definitely changes the flavor profile. I prefer it fresher. The beautiful aroma always punches you in the nose when first opening."
"Heady Topper","If you can ever get your hands on one. Enjoy it. Cause they are so hard to find. Roumor has it people have sold one can of that wonderful bliss in DC for around $50. That's crazy. But I've payed $9-10 for one."
"Heady Topper","Great smell and color, a must try for all beer enthusiasts. It says to drink out of the can, but i prefer in a glass."
"Heady Topper","Truly world class.  Super complex but so well balanced.  Nothing overpowering.  Citrus, grass, a little herbal, a little zing.  Amazing."
"Heady Topper","Very delicious beer, procured a can from a nice fellow I met while in Bruges, Belgium. All I can say is we need this in western Canada!"
"Heady Topper","Hard to live up to the hype but this was phenomenal. So glad I have 7 more. Flavor delivers with every sip. Smell is phenomenal."
"Heady Topper","Great beer"
"Heady Topper","With respect to John Kimmich, most of the time, I have drank this out of the can. However, for reviewing purposes, one must understand that as beer geeks we need to see this as it is."
"Heady Topper","The thing that makes this beer so prefect is the lack of imperfections. There is nothing wrong with it on any way and always a delight to have"
"Heady Topper","This beer is the best I have had the few times I have been (legally) drinking.  After pouring a can (which I know you're not supposed to do), I believe that IT IS TRULY BETTER FROM THE CAN!  This beer OUT OF CAN appearance is amber in color and slightly cloudy (similar to a micro-brew high ABV cider).  However In the can it's one of the best IPA locally produced.  "
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can, smells very citrusy, has a hazy yellow color, tastes of citrus with a great malt balance. Excellent imperial pale ale would certainly recommend this if you love DIPA. "
"Heady Topper","This was one of the best beers I have ever had and undoubtedly the best IPA. Very well balanced and complex the smell is much more different than the taste. The citrus and hop flavor cascades over your tongue and down your throat wonderfully, and has an indescribable complex flavor. Truely a beer lovers beer"
"Heady Topper","The best - bar none! This IPA lived up to its legend and exceeded my expectations. I would not have words to do it true justice. Also to note that I enjoyed this beer most when drinking it from the can for a little more of a fresh and piney hop quality."
"Heady Topper","This beer is truly flawless.  Unfortunately, I now compare every IPA/DIPA to this and none can replace it (although I've yet to try Focal Banger).  I like it better than SOS, Pliny, Julius, Zombie Dust as well as any other beer I've ever had (although SOS is a close second).  I'm not going to get technical on every aspect since there are plenty of those types of reviews.  I will say that this beer smells amazing, has a fruity taste (grapefruity) and goes down smooth.  I almost wish I never tasted this because now I am going obsess over acquiring as much as possible.  Good luck!  Cheers."
"Heady Topper","Hand-picked from a market in Waterbury, VT I highly recommend this beer. Flying from CA to VT for a day to pick up fresh cans instead of trading for them is highly-recommended no matter the expense. Treat yourself to the experience."
"Heady Topper","All that and a bag of chips..."
"Heady Topper","Just got around to trying this beer from The Alchemist and it definitely lived up to its hype. Unfortunately I only had one during a bottle share but i hope to get my hands on more. I first poured a little to try it in a tulip but left some to compare because on the can it literally states in bold ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"" and it honestly tasted way better from the can. "
"Heady Topper","Oh so close... Yet so far away. I miss it when I run out. One of the only beers I go out of my way for..."
"Heady Topper","Not over hyped at all.  And not my first time having this beer. I love it."
"Heady Topper","Finally got my hands on 4 cans. Thanks Mike and Mary. "
"Heady Topper","Appearance - Nice golden orange color, good lacing, but has the clarity of Yak Wool. "
"Heady Topper","Canning date unknown, but purchased on October 23rd, presumably from the 10/22 delivery day."
"Heady Topper","Just beautiful. Tasty with a PERFECT finish. How do they do that?"
"Heady Topper","Best beer ive ever drank,and was also a cool experience buying it up in Vermont waiting in line with 60 people at a gas station before the beer truck even showed up. Love everything about this beer, hoping to get a 1/6th keg for the kegerator!!"
"Heady Topper","First time pouring it from the can.  A very hazy, bright, golden yellow body with a snowy white head.  The hops make themselves known the moment you crack the can.  Lot of ripe citrus, lemon zest, tropical fruits, papaya, mango, a hint of melon, peach, and pine resin.  There's an excellent underlying sweet maltiness to this beer that I suspect is partially thanks to the conan yeast strain.   The mouth feel is very cream, medium-full, washed down by nice carbonation, followed by a pleasant sweet tropical lemon aftertaste.  On the flavor, sweet lime, grapefruit bitterness, lemon candy, peach, pine sap, some grass, papaya, honey malt, and melon.  "
"Heady Topper","From the can, at the beerlin beer week. Wonderfull and powerfull hop aroma, Peach,  papaya and ananas, little caramel, some dank nessuno presence and a little bit of Pine needless. Complex, sweet bready mlt with ananas, stone fruit, some citrus and piney.  Imbelievable, wonderfull beer."
"Heady Topper","pours a hazy yellow and the smell jumps right out. Drinks so amazingly smooth, really glad i had a chance to try this!"
"Heady Topper","Best beer I've ever had."
"Heady Topper","It is great to have kids who live in Burlington VT, and take care of their Dads.  I can never decide if I like this or SOS better.  What a great beer!"
"Heady Topper","Got this one from De Hopduvel in Ghent, BE. The next one I will drink from the can, but this one I had to dissect. No idea how fresh it is."
"Heady Topper","The beer has a hazy orange color. The aroma is tropical fruits, resin, and light malt. The taste is creamy, medium bitterness, light malt, tropical fruits, and resin."
"Heady Topper","Smells about the best ever! Full of flower notes. Super bitter, at first I thought it was kind of thin, but turns out it's complex as hell and moves around."
"Heady Topper","Just barely beats out the Elder Pliny for both aroma/bouquet and overall taste... I loved both but head2head, I would choose the Heady over the Pliny. They were so close (different tastes and complexities of pretty equal yum) that in my uneducated mind all I could think was that the water used by Heady made the difference in the end... might be wrong but seemed logical at the time."
"Heady Topper","Just got back from vacation and still had some Heady that I could review.  Even as someone who lives close to the Heady delivery locations, this is unnecessarily difficult to get a hold of.  Certainly a great beer, but I would recommend any of those dishearted to find this sold out to seek Lawson's Sip of Sunshine.  It's just as good imho but much more available."
"Heady Topper","Fresh Heady is amazing.  Older Heady is better than no Heady, although it does drop off a bit as it sits around.  Still a very sought after and highly drinkable DIPA.  One of my favorites!"
"Heady Topper","Exceptional double IPA.  No debate, no discussion.  This is not a review which argues that this beer is over hyped.  I think Alchemist are doing it the way it should be done.  Make an excellent product, sell it locally and don't expand.  "
"Heady Topper","Best hands down"
"Heady Topper","Lives up to the hype.  Best Ipa ive ever had.  Made a pilmrigage to vermont to track this down and came home with two cases.  may need to go to Vermont every year.   This beer is so juicy and so floral.  The hop profile and flavors change throughout the drink and throughout the life of the beer.  Every can pleased in a different way."
"Heady Topper","After trying this beer I understand the hype. From the moment I started drinking it I could not stop taking sips. It tasted like a hop milkshake. So creamy and delicious, each sip built upon the previous with loads of grassy, piney, and tropical flavor bursts balanced perfectly with an amazing yeast/malt backbone. Poured half into my Spiegelau IPA glass and drank the other half from the can. This beer is heavenly. It is the most well balanced beer I've ever had. Well done Alchemist!"
"Heady Topper","Lives up to the hype. Thank heavens for this beer and the alchemist brewers. The only part of the beer that I felt didn't live up to the IIPA standard of greatness for me was the aroma. It was beautiful - but it was not as much of an explosion as Pliny or SoS. Otherwise - truly an experience of a beer."
"Heady Topper","Maybe the best beer I have tasted. I had heard the hype and seen the rating. If you go to Vermont, you need to check out a local store and find out when their deliveries are. I was fortunate enough to score a case at a great spot on Route 7. Smooth, beautifully hopped, lightly malted, magnificently balanced, slightly sweet. Do drink it in the can. I resisted and tried a little bit in a glass first. It is better in the can. the Alchemist has mastered the ability to put a World Class Beer in a can. I'm enjoying one a night until they are gone and I look forward to another trip to Vermont. I will share with only my BEST friends."
"Heady Topper","I consider myself a relative newcomer to the world of craft beer, having gotten into it rather late in life. However, I consider myself a quick learner. I have been rating and reviewing beers on BA for a little more than a year now. I feel that day by day I'm acquiring more beer tasting experience and that my reviews are getting better. As a result of an increasingly discerning and sophisticated palate, I find that my reviews while mostly positive, are becoming less effusive in praise. This past spring, my father, after a trip from San Francisco, brought me at my request a few bottles of Pliny the Elder. Long story short, I thought it was quite possibly the tastiest and most perfectly balanced IPA I had ever had. I had no choice but to give it a perfect 5."
"Heady Topper","I have had this a couple times now....always fresh within 7 to 10 days from VT to my mouth. I did a blind tasting with heady, pliny the elder and sip of sunshine and heady and pliny were the top performers. All very strong beers....I have then done straight out of the can and as weird as it sounds it does add something. Are pliny or heady worth the effort.....if you love hops, and you want the experience....100% yes. If you love beer I think experiencing beers from those who love what you do is key....and The Alchemist love beer and what they do."
"Heady Topper","This is a great IPA for sure. Lots of pine and citrus up front. Smooth finish with nice balanced hops. Alcohol does get more pronounced after a few sips."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Craig for giving my one of these. Check this one off the list. I was sharing this with my neighbor so it was not consumed from the can per the directions."
"Heady Topper","This was for sure the best IPA I have ever had. Better than Pliny from the first sip to the last. Clean smell and taste, perfect balance. Carbonation was spot on. If you can get this, get it."
"Heady Topper","Description: Golden slightly cloudy color with a white head and lacing.  Aroma was a strong floral smell with some citrus, especially orange.  Taste was similar with floral and citrus up front.  There is some nice hoppy bitterness on the finish but it's not a hopbomb and is very well balanced.  I thought I detected some earthy/umami flavors as well but they were pretty masked.  The alcohol is present but like the bitterness is not overwhelming.  Carbonation is light to medium."
"Heady Topper","Hazy orange color, light fruity smell, very drinkable with a smooth feel. Overall this really was a good beer but not the one of the best on the East Coast in my opinion. They really need to start dating their cans to ensure that they are drunken in a timely fashion."
"Heady Topper","Very nice IPA, I enjoyed this more once I poured the last 1/4 into a glass, I'm going to try the next one in a glass from the get go. Heady had a very nice to it, the smell was not something I picked up well from the can, the taste seemed to be a little citrus with a very small bitter note from the can but was quite drinkable. Once it was in the glass it lost the very mild bitter taste I picked up and became a dipa I could crush!"
"Heady Topper","Excellent beer. Recommened to drink out of the can instead pouring into a bottle. Wonderful fruity aroma and delicious hoppy tasta. The great think about this IPA is that it lacks the bitterness that non-hopheads hate. Overall, a great drink and one that is worth the hype."
"Heady Topper","Nearly perfect. This beautiful IPA actually lived up to the hype. Sampled two cans-- one straight from the can and one in a glass (to view). I can confirm that drinking it straight from the can is better... but just slightly. The smoothness and citrus fruit shines through beyond all else. Loved it."
"Heady Topper","Pours a light cloudy orange with adequate frothy white head. Aroma of tropical fruit, pine, slight floral and herbal, pineapple, mango and melon with tropical fruit esters (pear/peach)from the yeast. Flavor matches the aroma and add a very slight malty sweetness that is just enough to play off of the perfect amount of bitterness in this beer. A touch of wheat also. Mouthfeel is light but with a slightly creamy fruit juice feel to it... Overall awesome DIPA."
"Heady Topper","Heaven in a can."
"Heady Topper","no copy cat will do"
"Heady Topper","Being raised in VT I had to give this a try albeit on accident.  I drank it from the can therefore I could not see the beer but I am assuming it looks the part.  I have never have been an IPA fan but the nose was dank, dank, pine and resin.  The taste was not like anything I had tasted before, I assume people like the taste and this beer but it was a drain pour for me.  Thankfully I had a friend that wanted and could not find it to buy and was very happy to get the remainder as a gift.  I appreciate all different types of beer but I could not drink this.  Judging from its reviews it is very popular and well liked I just could not get behind this."
"Heady Topper","L-A hazy golden peach color with a full inch of white fluffy head. Lacing clings to the sides in layers as I drink."
"Heady Topper","One of the best Imperial IPA's period."
"Heady Topper","I drove ten hours from Toronto to Vermont, some of which was spent in total darkness through torrential rain, partly, just to try this beer. Once I arrived at the White Horse Inn in Waitsfield, I had my first taste."
"Heady Topper","Tough to really add much that hasn't been said many times already below, but here goes.  Poured out just a tiny bit to see what it looks like but otherwise almost every time I have drank it from the can as they emphasize.  Delicious and great double IPA, with citrusy, piney hop taste.  However, what many reviews fail to mention is that in my experience, Heady produces multiple waves of flavor that continue even after you have swallowed the beer.  I guess the can says something about ""wave after wave of hoppy goodness"" and in my experience this isn't just marketing hype.  That really is how it tastes, and the multiple waves of flavor is not something I have experienced with almost any other beer.  Very interesting and my favorite part about this beer.  Overall it's fantastic and definitely worth seeking out.  However, it is NOT worth the degree of crazed hype associated with it.  I can think of a dozen hoppy beers I have had this year that I'd rather have over Heady.  In fact, it's not even the best DIPA made by the brewery (Focal Banger is outstanding).  That doesn't mean I don't say yes any time very fresh Heady is offered to me as part of a trade...you should definitely try it at least once."
"Heady Topper","Had part out of the can and the rest in a glass.  I prefer it out of a glass."
"Heady Topper","amazing!  Don't really know what i was expecting when my brother in law presented this after several days of anticipation but i can say it was worth the wait.  Possibly the best ipa/dipa i have ever sampled!  Seriously contemplating the 3.5 hr drive+ 1hr wait in line for a case of this..."
"Heady Topper","Love me some topper! excellent beer!"
"Heady Topper","One of my favorites. Just wish I could still get a cone of fries at The Alchemist, too."
"Heady Topper","The hype is real. Took a few days to get used to the taste, but this is by far the best beer I've ever had. Tastes hoppy with a hint of pine. Perfect for a summer on Lake Champlain."
"Heady Topper","One of my all time favorites. I love this thing I drank this from the can. Fantastic beverage can't find too much that even taste like it but there are some that try. Hands down the best!!!"
"Heady Topper","Look: Poured into a glass, despite the suggestion of drinking from the can. (I was sharing it with two other people). A hazy yellow color with LOTS of fluffy head which lingers and leaves a nice lacing."
"Heady Topper","The hype is real. Pine, grapefruit, earth, citrus zest all compete in a no holds bar cage fight in your mouth were the only winner is you. Like a synchronize swim team every flavor plays its roll and comes together in harmonious crescendo that leaves angels agape of the marvels they witness. Dry finish yet creamy mouthfeel. Hop bitterness to an extreme that somehow is as smooth as a freshly waxed Lamborghini. This beer is the quintessential definition of polar opposite. I don't care how it's done. Just keep doing it."
"Heady Topper","No hype here as this is the real deal.   My can was gifted from a regular trading buddy, so no clue of age.   The small bit I poured had a straw yellow body with a touch of hazy.   A bit more head would have been nice.   The nose is best in class - straight citrus hop pine resin goodness.  Perfect.  The flavors match the nose with peppery grapefruit, grass, and hop resins with a perfectly planned background sweetness to manage some of the bitterness.   Mouth feel is fresh, super peppery, and well carbonated.   It meets the hype."
"Heady Topper","I don't know what the big talk was about this IPA. I finally found it in Vermont after a lot of searching but was not delighted with the taste."
"Heady Topper","Tasted was Greatness. The after taste is literally thirst quenching, by far the best IPA ive ever had, and to top it off its a double IPA, Smell is floral with a solid hop aroma."
"Heady Topper","Look - poured a little out to get look, then drank rest from can as instructed by the can.  Pours a hazy orange."
"Heady Topper","Pours a beautiful hazy golden orange with a big fluffy, ""heady"", white two finger head that has some great sticky staying power. Big aroma notes of orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and barky pine dance with that beautifully subtle, yet distinct Vermont yeast. Take a sip and perfectly soft, medium mouthfeel bring wave after wave of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine along with a touch of dank grassiness and a nice, gentle malt sweetness. It's so balanced. So intense, yet so delicate. The bitterness is there in amount enough to just perfectly support everything else that's going on. It lives up to the hype. So good."
"Heady Topper","Gets better as you drink it."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a Duvel glass. The hype is real. Wish this was more readily available, but then again, good things are best enjoyed every once in awhile. What is in the water in Vermont ......."
"Heady Topper","Possibly the only IPA I have ever truly enjoyed. They are not for me, but it is undeniable that Heady Topper is beautiful."
"Heady Topper","The first one, it was truly worth my wait.  Taste is superb."
"Heady Topper","This beer isn't perfect, but it's damn near perfect. Smell is dank and tropical, but the taste is just remarkably better. Sweet mango, tropical fruits, followed by a pine dankness that's just amazing. A lingering amazing darkness that I've never really tasted like this before. The mouth feel is creamy and full, yet extremely drinkable still."
"Heady Topper","Very anxious to try this. Been trying to trade for it all summer. Canned Sept.7th"
"Heady Topper","16oz can"
"Heady Topper","Pours an opaque straw color. Looks like grapefruit/pineapple juice. Big aroma of citrus and tropical fruit with slight addition of fresh cut grass. Taste is grapefruit, pineapple, mango, grape, and dank hops. Its not too sweet or too bitter. The bite from the hops is just enough to balance the juicy fruit flavor. Mouth feel is medium and very creamy with a dry finish. Definitely lived up to the hype. A very well crafted beer."
"Heady Topper","16 oz recent can release."
"Heady Topper","Drank from can. "
"Heady Topper","Smells of pineapple, mild pine and mango rind. Tastes very similar to the aroma. Piney, bitter, resiny, no malt sweetness. Mouth feel was crisp, clean, light and smooth. Good stuff! Very dank. Bitter and resiny finish. I'm not going to say that this is the best DIPA in the market, as some would say, but it is very good. I'm glad to have tried it. Definitely buy it if you find it but don't go crazy looking for it or pay more than $10 for a can. CHEERS! "
"Heady Topper","Firsttime reviewing heady! its more of a stupid list of simple opinions/ facts, cause like, its all been said. Here we go..."
"Heady Topper","Received in a trade, poured half into a tulip and drank the other half straight from the can. Hazy gold/amber. Sweet juicy hop aroma. Very well balanced, just enough malt to really showcase the hops. The mouthfeel is better than any other ipa/dipa I've ever had! Lives up to the hype."
"Heady Topper","Worth the trip! Enjoyed right from the can, perfectly balanced,  prefer hop forward bitter iipa, this is the joe college of iipa style. It's really really good."
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from the can. Pleasant hop aroma. Dank grassy flavors, creamy mouthfeel. Finish is slightly earthy. There is a touch of smoke in there as well. Overall, this is a tried and trued DIPA."
"Heady Topper","pours out a hazy golden orange with bright white head that leaves some nice lacing. aromas of herbs and pine, bubblegum, honey, apricots & peach, orange, grapefruit, grassy hops. on palate is peach, orange, grapefruit, honey soaked mango, sweet bready malts, gummy sweetness, matched by resinous pine, earthy dankness and green herbal notes. mouthfeel is medium bodied with some nice fluff. "
"Heady Topper","Broke the rules and poured it out of the can into a chalice. This beer was canned three weeks ago."
"Heady Topper","A beautiful beer with subtle citrus notes. Smooth and easy drinking. Hops are solid but not overpowering. One could sit and drink a lot of this in one sitting."
"Heady Topper","This looked a bit more viscous than most IPA's. It smelled light, and refreshing, with the slightest amount of citrus, to intrigue. The taste was far more full than I had anticipated, with what seemed like many hop varieties joining together to make for a wonderful experience. The best part for me was the mouthfeel, as I think it had almost a nitro smoothness, as it was creamy and heavy. Overall, I wish I had more than three cans..!"
"Heady Topper","I wanted to love this beer considering everyone else does but unfortunately I did not. I drank it from the can as it suggests and I think it suffered from not being poured. I'm willing to try it again."
"Heady Topper","Best IPA I've tried to date. Great beer, wish I could find it on the west coast."
"Heady Topper","Finally! "
"Heady Topper","Poured a little into a glass and color is a cloudy golden orange. Deep hop aroma, lots of pine, resin & citrus. I drank the rest from the can. Flavor is huge resin and pine. You get citrus, a touch of sweetness. The flavor continues to develop with a bubbly crispness. The finish is smooth and leaves a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. This beer is definitely better out of the can and overall I can't find any issue. This is a perfect beer. Maybe not the best I've ever had but still a perfect beer"
"Heady Topper","This is the real deal. Best IPA in the country hands down IMHO . New England births the best, especially Northern VT."
"Heady Topper","Brother brought home a few cans for Thanksgiving when he was a student at UVM. He said it was the best double IPA he had ever had. I was intrigued. The admonition to drink it from the can is one that should be heeded for the best experience of the brew, To pour it into a glass would be a discredit. For one thing, the beer is unfiltered. By pouring it onto a glass, you would see all the detritus from the hops and yeast floating around. if poured from the can into a glass, you also lose the best way to experience all the aromatic hops. Do yourself a solid, and drink it from the can. "
"Heady Topper","They manage to shove an EXTREME amount of hoppy flavor without the aftertaste of licking a bail of hay that most extreme IPA's give.  It is good, but I just can't force myself to join the extreme IPA crowd.  If that is your thing, drink this beer."
"Heady Topper","This is the best IPA ive ever had the pleasure of drinking. Has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. Really surprised I have yet to rate it until now."
"Heady Topper","I was lucky enough to get some Heady Topper last week on a trip up to VT. I stood in line for two hours total at a couple of different places in Burlington and ended up with a little over a case, it was completely worth the wait. It is the most drinkable IPA I've ever tasted, very smooth, and as the can says it leaves you with ""wave after wave of hoppy goodness!"" Not to mention at 8% ABV one or two of these bad boys will leave feeling nice and hopped up. I only wish they would make more so more people could try this amazing beer!"
"Heady Topper","Not perfect, but the most drinkable DIPA I've had. Beautiful beer with a huge aroma that fills a room, the taste does not quite follow the aroma (which may make it more drinkable) and the feel is a bit thinner than I'd like for a DIPA (also, making it more drinkable).  Could crush these all day if Vermonter's weren't so selfish!"
"Heady Topper","had a friend of a friend ship a few cans of heady out to chicago. "
"Heady Topper","I was lucky enough to have this in the same flight as Pliny the Younger.  It held up too.  Nice taste and nose, but after a long day of tasting, I couldn't quite put my finger on the aftertaste that I was getting.  I think it was the combo of pine and orange."
"Heady Topper","Wow lives up to the hype, just a delicious beer straight from the can, doesn't get better had this fresh like 3 days fresh and honestly I can see how this beer redefines DIPA's there is nothing else like this."
"Heady Topper","Finally, getting to try the legendary Heady Topper.  Sent to me by BigStein here on BA.  Thanks!"
"Heady Topper","Absolutely amazing...up until now Pliny the Elder was my fave ever...recently a friend and his wife were passing thru Vermont at the right time and I got 36 of these bad boys...opened my first yesterday...just a beautiful beverage. Hoppy, smooth and with an incredible nose, lots of pine and nice lingering hoppy flavour with just a touch of bitterness out the back. I followed the rules and drank from the can...but the next one will be in a glass..."
"Heady Topper","Still the best IPA out there. It is the all IPA's are judged against and for a good reason."
"Heady Topper","Great beer. Shame its so hard to get. Aroma is fruity with resin and pine goodness.   The flavor is more pine to me and I think the label is spot on here with....""dense hoppy finish in your mouth.  I think that dense and oily mouth feel is the best I've ever had! One of the smoothest and easy drinking IPAs I've had.  I'm drinking this side by side with Todd the Axeman and I'm not ashamed to say I prefer the aroma and taste of Todd but the feel of Heady a bit more. I wouldn't turn down either tho."
"Heady Topper","gold standard for any beer. Excellent hoppy characteristic, perfectly balanced, perfect taste and feel. This beer changed by drinking  preference from Scotch/wine to beer"
"Heady Topper","Such an amazing beer! It's so hard for a beer like this to stand up to the hype, but it does."
"Heady Topper","Glad I was able to enjoy this great beer. Pours great and has a wonderful cloudy orange color.  Has a nice juicy pop up front with a smooth creamy finish. Can't wait to get it again."
"Heady Topper","Made the trip up to VT to snag a case of this, and it was worth the drive time.  I understand how this beer has stayed on the top of the charts for so long.  Great orange color, with citrus not only in the smell but throughout the taste.  Definitely a world-class beer"
"Heady Topper","Sublime. ."
"Heady Topper","A beer well worth the pursuit"
"Heady Topper","Had this a few times, solid brew but a little bit inconsistent (tasted slightly different each time). Would love to go up to VT and get it fresh within hours of it being canned (most of what my beer group brings down to PA is around a week old."
"Heady Topper","The myth, the legend, the Heady Topper. Finally got to try some and I can see the mass appeal."
"Heady Topper","I have had this beer too many times to count, and it never fails to disappoint. To consistently brew something this flavorful is crazy. The beer is hazy golden, with nary a floatie in it. The taste explodes with tropical and citrus, but enough hop bitterness to keep it from being a juice bomb. A fantastic beer that everyone should try at least once."
"Heady Topper","Floral burst as soon as you open the can. Piney taste is forward. A youch of citrus follows. Slo-fade bitterness through the finish. It is a classic that is consistent from can to can."
"Heady Topper","A- straw nyellow, hints of gold "
"Heady Topper","Delicious beer. Part of the fun of this is how hard it is to get. I lucked out when we happened to be in Stowe, VT on the day they get their shipment. While it was one of the best double IPA's I've had, I can't call it the best beer in the world as some do. In my humble opinion, I'd put Pliny neck & neck. Cheers."
"Heady Topper","Great beer just difficult to get"
"Heady Topper","Great clean flavor."
"Heady Topper","Completely lived up to its expectations"
"Heady Topper","Appearance:  pours a pale straw yellow color, which is interesting because my friend, another drink it from the can rule breaker said his poured almost orange.  A very fine bubbled head that dissipates quickly to a thin line where beer meets glass.  "
"Heady Topper","One of the most beautiful looking beers I've ever poured. Cloudy golden orange color with a bright white head. Nose is very fruity with loads of hop. Flavor was not what I expected. I didn't expect as much pine flavor as I got, especially given the citrusy nose. I got more fruit flavor as it wamed though. Feel was spot on. Great carbonation almost champagne like. Good beer but not sure it lived up to the hype."
"Heady Topper","Looks beautiful. Hazy Orange smells just like pulped Orange Juice. High amounts of grapefruit and grapefruit bitterness. Excellent beer, best double ipa? Doubtful"
"Heady Topper","From the can (this gimmick annoys me but for brewer suggestion I will comply)"
"Heady Topper","While drinking a lovely IPA from ""Fiddlehead,"" the waiter presented an ice cold can (I'd never seen) and instructed, ""If you think that was good, try this.""  With the latency of lightning came a surprise the likes of which I had never before experienced and have yet to duplicate since.  Like the picture on the can, simply mind blowing.  For a hop loving homo sapient such as myself, there is no beer I would rather have in hand, no commercial graphic that signals ultimate gustatory pleasure is imminent.  Across look, smell, taste, and feel, as Billy Crystal might say, ""Simply mahvelous, darling.""  I'd give it a 6, if I could."
"Heady Topper","Wonderful!!! Dankness"
"Heady Topper","Best ever."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a glass:"
"Heady Topper","Pours hazy gold with a nice frothy white head with great retention (though it does fade) and some nice sticky lacing."
"Heady Topper","Finally reviewing Heady Topper. The beer we are asked to drink from the can. It is a very nice can, but I pour just a small amount of it into a glass to see the hazy straw, pale lemon yellow body with very little head to speak of. But since the beer's appearance is not supposed to be a part of the experience,  I won't grade harshly on that. "
"Heady Topper","Happiness lives up to the hype! Rose early for a rural, winding trek to a small grocer on The Alchemist's delivery route during my first trip to the Green Mountain State. Scored a case (cans only) which makes the trip worth all the effort! Pours a rich, moderately cloudy golden orange, like fresh nectar, with a medium head and tight lacing. Notes of mango and citrus reach out and smack the nose hairs immediately. Taste is powerfully citrus, cream and pine with a semi-sweetish flowery, tropical tenor; hoppiness finishes fast with no lingering bitterness. Careful - it begs to be gulped, but this should be savored. Bring your stopwatch. I have a case though, so perhaps a grandfather clock ;)"
"Heady Topper","BEST IPA on the market (if you can find that market)"
"Heady Topper","Words are barely adequate to describe the range of this beer.  Pours a golden orange color.  Cloudy but the brewery advises you to drink from the can so you don't have the sediment in the glass.  If you drink from the can you miss all the citrus at the nose.  This is a perfectly balanced DIPA that is crisp, drinkable and balanced in hops and bitterness."
"Heady Topper","As if anyone needs another review of this beer.  Stood in line for 3 hours in Winooski VT to get this."
"Heady Topper","Well after many years and having tried over 300 IPA's i finally got my hands on a can of Heady Topper."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can. Pours cloudy yellow, thick white head. Fruity bready aroma.  Grapefruit and earthy hops throughout the sip, super juicy and perfect balance. Creamy soft mouth.  Dry finish with clean crisp sweetness. Overall this one deserves the high ratings, phenomenal."
"Heady Topper","Purchased 4-pk of 16oz cans at bottle shop in Winooski, VT  in mid-October 2014...delivered that day from the brewery. "
"Heady Topper",unfiltered
"Heady Topper","It has been a while since I had this one, A good friend brought some up from Vermont when I lived in Quebec, and it didn't dissapoint, it might be overhyped, but credit is due for an exceptional balance to a insane tropical fruit hop blast that is refreshing, and not lingering or vegital."
"Heady Topper","Pours almost orange with a bit of haze.  The aroma is amazing.  I get lots of pine from it.  At first sip you get pine quickly followed by tropical fruit.  So balanced, so drinkable.  You honestly don't realize it's 8%."
"Heady Topper","L - Orange with edges fading to yellow. Cloudy but not overly. I see why they say drink from the can."
"Heady Topper","Doesn't really get much better. Consistency is important and that's what you get with this beer."
"Heady Topper","I was never a fan of IPAs before I had heady and now I can't get enough hops. Great crisp double IPA, tons of floral hops, great mouth feel and finish."
"Heady Topper","Rating is based on drinking from the can (with the look rating from an earlier can I poured into a glass).  Smell is heavily floral, citrus, pine, onion, and just a hint of malt sweetness.  Taste is tropical fruit mixed with pine, floral almost lavender-like taste, and a clean hop bitterness.  Some double IPAs leave an increasingly bitter aftertaste with each sip, but Heady feels fresh every sip.  Taste is extremely balanced, making the beer exceptionally drinkable.  Mouthfeel is interesting, with an almost creamy feel.  One of the only beers I've ever had that completely lives up to the hype.  Wish I had regular access to it!"
"Heady Topper","Finally got to try some. Drank out of the can, as per instructions. Big smell of pine. Very easy drinking for a double Ipa. All around a delicious beer. Probably not the best beer in the world though."
"Heady Topper","I've had to drink a few cans of this (yeah, I got a case!) before I felt like I was ready to write a review.  After all, this is the legendary Heady.  I didn't go gaga over it at first sip so I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my palate.  Maybe I was missing something.  Or maybe it is all just hype.  I've decided it's probably a combination of the two.  It's not my favorite style of beer, but it is admittedly one of the most interesting examples of the DIPA style I've had."
"Heady Topper","Finally got my hands on this beer. Wow is it good. Was expecting a bit more wow from all the hype but didn't get it. Pliny blew me away but heady just delivered. But by no means am I disappointed. Cannot wait to get more of this."
"Heady Topper","Can. Vermont trip. 8 bought"
"Heady Topper","Totally worth the 2 Sip O Sunshine that I had to trade to get it!  It definitely lives up to the hype.  What a wonderful flavor!"
"Heady Topper","Heady-Topper is best in Class period - enough said!"
"Heady Topper","This beer is a perfect example of an east coast DIPA. So incredibly smooth yet the amazing hop bitterness is still there. The smell is that of citrus goodness and the carbonation is spot on perfect."
"Heady Topper","Amazing east coast IPA. Perfectly balanced beer with piney, citrusy notes and strong hop profile.  Really smooth despite the bitterness.  Great beer...perfect opposite to Pliny -- a premier east coast IPA opposite of Pliny being the premier west coast IPA."
"Heady Topper","My buddy brought me back 8 from Vermont. Very hop to the hoppy!!"
"Heady Topper","Thanks Adam for the can!"
"Heady Topper","This is the Apple of DIPAs. It will be the one that people compare the ""best beer"" to for the foreseeable future. It is my favorite beer at the moment and is well worth the trip to VT"
"Heady Topper","Gold standard for hoppy beer."
"Heady Topper","Not sure of some the the recent low 4 ratings, almost like there is a pushback against being the ""cool kid"" for too long. Unless some were given a random can not kept cold for the trip to whatever state they came across one in. Nonetheless this beer is truly amazing. And all the beers I've been lucky enough to have in say the top 20 on this board, it really is like splitting hairs of subjectivity. This is a big beer that can really showcase a dipa to people who think they don't like them. Extremely drinkable. Clean. Fresh. Personally I enjoy it better out of can as directed. But have had multiple times and poured in a glass as well to get a look and release a wonderful bouqet.  Many master reviewers here have already described it so well in great detail. All I can say is ""agreed!""  I suspect the ones that demerit it have some sort of ulterior motive in trying to unseat the multi-year King.  Oh well. Doesn't change the experience. And I'm sure the alchemist crew could care less what the rating is. They know they are doing a truly wonderful job.  It is a bit of a circus obtaining at times, but hey, adds to the thrill of the chase.   Ps. Focal banger is every bit as good."
"Heady Topper","Let's start off by saying that I am not an IPA fan or a Double IPA fan. This beer however, changed my view of this particular style of beer. The first thing you notice is the fresh citrusy smell of the hops followed by the smell of pine. The beer starts off with a very hop forward taste and finishes with the customary hoppy IPA finish. I must say that this beer is unbelievably drinkable and is overall pleasing to the palate. A pleasant surprise since beers with this high of an IBU tend to be overly bitter and very hard to drink. Finally a beer worthy of its ranking."
"Heady Topper","Taste of the beer one of the best IPA on the market "
"Heady Topper","Poured it into a glass, color wise pretty lack luster. Definitely a unique style of IPA I hadn't really had before. Sort of a cross between classic hoppy, bitter west cost and malt forward east coast styles. Great aroma, very balanced bitterness but for me - didn't quite live up to the incredible hype. Delicious beer, absolutely but left me wanting a little more."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a glass! Screw following the can, I need to see the beer."
"Heady Topper","First time with Heady. Have to say that the stand out part of it is the smoothness. I've had other IPA's with more flavor, other's with more happiness, but never any so smooth that goes down that easy. Truly a great IPA."
"Heady Topper","I have no idea what it looks like because I was told to Drink From The Can!"
"Heady Topper","Can. Excellent ALE. Full bodied with an excellent taste. Smooth going down and a good smell. Yes this is worth all the hype. Can only purchase in VT and you are very limited. I had a friend give me 1 can."
"Heady Topper","Retouching this review for a 3rd time. What once was an amazing beer saw a couple years that seemed to left me wondering what happened to that amazing beer I had. Got my hands on one of the recent runs from the new brewery and I'm happy to say it was right back to the original beer I feel in love with. Big pine and soft peaches in perfect harmony with an earthy malt body. Exstatic to see all systems go for these guys"
"Heady Topper","Dated 7/13/15; drank in tulip glass on 7/27/15"
"Heady Topper","Outstanding aroma, balance, flavors and finish."
"Heady Topper","I followed the can's directions so not sure how it looks but everything else is brilliant! A pure champion. Might have to take a road trip just to get some more. I'm hoping the name is a nod to Topper Headon!"
"Heady Topper","I'm not sure how old the can I drank was at time of consumption.  I gave ""smell"" a 4.25 however I have to believe a beer this big has a big aroma when fresh.  With that said, please take the 4.25 aroma as suspect.  Taste and Feel live up to the hype for sure!"
"Heady Topper","I can see how people think of this as a trophy brew. It's very good,huge citrus smack. Like drinking a glass (yep,didn't read the instructions) of grapefruit juice. Had a slight,bitter (lemon) aftertaste. Overall,a wonderful brew."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip glass. Nose is of huge grapefruit and grapes, absolutely fantastic. Taste was not as good, but tons of piny and citrus bitterness. Is an upper tier upper, top 5%, but not the best, the new wave of east coast ipa's are crushing it, would take numerous ipa's from Other Half & Trillium instead, and they are easier to obtain than Heady."
"Heady Topper","The best there is."
"Heady Topper","Purchased in Montpelier, VT on July 20, 2015 (the same day that it came off the delivery truck) and consumed with notes taken the following day.  In other words, this baby was fresh."
"Heady Topper","One of the few Double IPA'S that deserves the hype it gets and definitely the one that set the bar. Yes, there is Treehouse and Hillfarmstead but heady in my opinion paved the way for other great New England Ipa's."
"Heady Topper","I'm going to go similar to Blackboard on this review..."
"Heady Topper","I don't throw around high scores on beers but this one totally deserves it. This does not taste like any other Double IPA I have tried before. Even with its 100 IBUs, the first thnig that washs over your palate is not 'bitter' but 'fresh'. Like drinking a newly mown lawn fresh. And smooth. It's hard to describe. The only knock is on the look which is pale and slightly cloudy but maybe that's why they encourage drinking from the can :-).  Drove 900 miles from Virginia and waited in line for 90 minutes at Winooski Beverage to get my hands on a case to bring back to share with friends."
"Heady Topper","This is one of those beers that I've had on multiple occasions at multiple different freshness dates. It's fantastic don't get me wrong, but I've never had a can (even one that was canned less than 5 days old) where I was absolutely dumbfounded how good it is."
"Heady Topper","Best IPA I have ever had. Most amazing aroma off of a beer. Lots of juiciness in the taste with citrus and pine dominating. Taste lingers with a great bitter finish."
"Heady Topper","Well, here it goes. The number 1 (now 2) beer in the world. Pours a gorgeous hazy orange. Smells of citrus, pine and hoppy goodness. Tastes follows through. Awesome creamy mouthfeel. I can definitely see why this is the top beer. It's amazing, if just a hair under focal banger, due to a bit too much bitterness on the backend for my taste (but I'm just splitting hairs). Amazing stuff!"
"Heady Topper","I never get tired of drinking this.  Drinking this against most other popular IPA's and Double IPA's will make them taste too harsh or malty or grassy."
"Heady Topper","Really well made brew. Definitely worth the hype."
"Heady Topper","Fortunate enough to have been drinking this for years. Still top-notch and consistent as ever."
"Heady Topper","Oh, What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz.  Special beer, from a special place.  Truly not much more needs to be said.  Drink it from the can and drink it in Vermont."
"Heady Topper","Tasted many times first can to the head. Such an easy drinking yet complex ipa."
"Heady Topper","I was extremely lucky to be given a can recently. This is definitely an excellent DIPA and the best I've ever had. I drank half from the can as it recommends and half from an IPA glass. Honestly it was better from the glass but to each their own."
"Heady Topper","anyone want to trade for some breakfast stout from last year?"
"Heady Topper","Classic double IPA. One of the best around- can't beat this beer fresh, might be the best IPA in the world. The most balanced of the style ever."
"Heady Topper","Perfect.  Lives up to the hype.  Even better with good friends."
"Heady Topper","Drank most from the can but the appearance from what I did pour in the glass was beautiful. So smooth with tons of Tropical fruit upfront, balanced resin finish. In the top 10 for sure."
"Heady Topper","Not the best IPA I've ever had, but it's something every beer fanatic should try. It revolutionized the beer game and for that I am thankful. An excellent beer"
"Heady Topper","Exceptional IPA, the hype for this beer is defiantly where it should be."
"Heady Topper","Really excellent IPA,.  Tons of grapefruit on the nose and palate.  Very balanced for the high level of bitterness.  An all-around excellent beer."
"Heady Topper","Just a solid DIPA, but there's nothing to rave about here."
"Heady Topper","I feel like trying this beer is a craft beer lovers rite of passage and I was finally able to cross this one odd my list. I really enjoyed it and found it to be extremely drinkable and not overly hoppy for a DIPA. At the same time I can't say it was the cathartic experience I was hoping for, but rather just a very good beer. Will habe again if given the opportunity, but this will probably be my last time hunting it down"
"Heady Topper","It is the best beer I have tasted. It has a very smooth inviting aroma, great body, and what I personally like best, a great after taste. It literally lingers in my mouth for a couple hours after I finished the beer."
"Heady Topper","The Best of the Rest"
"Heady Topper","Wow - given 100 score on BA was expecting so much more, just an avg+ 2×IPA for me.  Will try again, certainly not bad though."
"Heady Topper","this beer is hop heaven and perfectly balanced"
"Heady Topper","I had this brew for the first time the other night. I work at a homebrew supply shop in Southern PA and a customer was kind enough to get some cans for us. It is a fantastic brew, but certainly not the best I've had -- but it's all subjective! I compare this to Lawson's Sip of Sunshine, and I have to say that Lawson's beer wins this one for me. Nevertheless, if you get a chance the try this beer, do it! You certainly won't regret it."
"Heady Topper","Just an all around show stopping beer. Lots of tropical fruit that comes in wave after delicious wave with a touch of a lemon grass in there. Bitterness not overwhelming, but a nice balance . A truly great beer."
"Heady Topper","What more can be said...a truly great beer."
"Heady Topper","I was hooked at first sip. After lusting after this beer for years I finally got to try it several times recently, thanks to friends, and I have to say it really lived up to the hype. I can't think of a beer I've heard more about and the whole experience still managed to live up. I can understand know how this beer really broke the way for others like it that have come since. Also more good beer like this needs to be put into cans."
"Heady Topper","Highly drinkable citrusy goodness. "
"Heady Topper","Pours golden orange and hazy and chalky.  Smells like fruit with some hops and sweet malts.  Taste is like a breath of fresh air.  Bitter and crisp, with citrus and dry bready finish.  Fantastic malt flavor, heavily hopped but it retains balanced.  Great flavor and drinkability from start to finish.  This beer can be on the inconsistent side.  My first review of this beer was a 4.78/5... but after having had multiple since then, I figured it needed a new review.  Still delicious, but it can be the victim of inconsistency."
"Heady Topper","I've been looking forward to trying this for years now. Living in NJ I can't tell you how many times I've had friends or co workers promise they would bring back some from a trip to VT or "" my buddy/cousin/whoever lives up there, I'll get them to bring it down "" but all fell through.  I finally decided to take a road trip. I planned it well and did the round trip in a day, came back w 2 cases plus some other VT beers.  Successful trip I'd say.  Anyway, with all the hype and what I had to go through to get some Heady I was finally  ready to see for myself.  Well - I can see why this beer gets all the talk.  This isn't even my favorite style, I'm a BBA Stout guy but I must say this is a fantastic brew.  Outrageous flavor that just keeps getting better.  No question Heady is deserving of its # 1 status.  Long live the king !!"
"Heady Topper","A friend brought me a can from his VT trip.  WOW!  Nice aroma.  Well-balanced.  I like the use of malt that allows you to enjoy the hops and not be overrun by them.  Heady has now moved into a first place tie with Bell's Hopslam as my ATF.  Problem is now I want another one and I'm not planning any trips to VT in the near future!"
"Heady Topper","I was given a can by an extremely generous BA on here, this was my white whale and I have now slayed it and it was worth every ounce of hype.  I took the first sip and it was great, maybe not the best beer I've ever had but it was up there.  The more it warmed up it got better with every sip until I could literally think of nothing I would change about the beer.  A steady supply of this would be dangerous, and IIPA's aren't even my favorite style of beer but this is my favorite beer I have tried yet in my short time diving in to craft beer.  Side note, I drank about half from a glass and half from the can, and maybe it's just in my head because they tell you to on the can, but I think I liked straight from the can a little better."
"Heady Topper","Great IPA. No bad after taste juat delicious light and easy to drink. Def recommend if you can get your hands on it"
"Heady Topper","Well.. it wasn't MIND BLOWING... but it was a perfectly balanced IPA... not my favorite, but I'd get it again."
"Heady Topper","I'm not going to do the typical L S T F O stuff that is on this site for this beer. I have frequented the site for years and years and this is the beer that made me have to do a review. I was skeptical when I obtained this beer. It can't be worth the hype. It can't be as good as this website says it is. I'm here to write that it is, without a doubt, the most incredible DIPA I have ever had. Not too strong, yet still flavorful. Still aromatic. I drank it form the can so I can't comment on the look but I don't care. This is a beer that is extremely hard for me to obtain in the area I am. I never thought I would get this beer. And now that I have, every IPA I have ever had fails in comparison. It was perfect."
"Heady Topper","A - The beauty here is in seeing what is coming, but the golden orange body, opaque, and moderate thin white head, are not stunning.  The can art is great, and it is not a bad looking beer, but it is not exceptionally good looking."
"Heady Topper","Great beer. Solved the problem with the supply of Heady Topper. I just brewed a clone version and was virtually identical."
"Heady Topper","Don't know how it looks, following the directions and drinking from the can!  Smells of hops, pine, grapefruit, kind of muted coming from the can.  Taste is as advertised, wave after wave of hops, juicy citrus and some resinous pine but just enough malt to keep it balanced.  Moderately carbed and medium body keeps this pretty easy drinking.  Overall, good IPA, still not sure it deserves all the hype, a lot of others out there that are just as good."
"Heady Topper","This is a great beer. I think the exclusivity feeds the hype a bit. Its hype creates a few more naysayers among the people ive talked to about it.  Nonetheless, its at the top of the list for a reason. Great taste, packs a punch, drink it in the can like it says, i do notice a difference. Its got that murky unfiltered look anyway so the glass wont do much for you.  I cant tell yet if i like this or Lawsons sip o' sunshine better.  But i do know i wish both companies expanded their distribution to other areas than vermont."
"Heady Topper","I could drink this all day long. Superb!"
"Heady Topper","Got one can given to me by a customer at my job in buffalo new york, and it was absolute perfection to my taste buds. I would recommend this masterpiece to anyone. My only disappointment is that the brewery is 7 hours from my house, and it's nearly impossible to obtain even a can around here."
"Heady Topper","Finally got my hands on a couple cans of it and it didn't dissapoint. Poured the last of my can into a pint glass just to get a look at it. One of the few beers that lives up to the hype! A crushable dipa for sure."
"Heady Topper","Astounding. Perfect on every level. With each sip, the full hop flavor comes through just as much, if not more, than the first sip."
"Heady Topper","Awesome beer. I was fortunate enough to try this from a friend who brought a couple cans home with him to NJ. It's definitely one of my favorites."
"Heady Topper","pours a a hazed golden yellow with a white head nice retention/lacing,smell was floral and tropical but not overly so,taste fantastic array of citrus,floral,tropical taste with just a kiss of sweet malts -superb,mouth  feel was medium carbonation with very little bitterness, supreme 2ipa here easy to drink with a great hop profile ABV well hidden"
"Heady Topper","Heady is my favorite IPA so far, although IPA is not my favorite style.  For me, an IPA needs to have something to set it apart, as a lot of hoppy beers taste the same to me.  Heady has a really nice pine scent and taste that I have not seen duplicated elsewhere.  It really just tastes like Vermont; you can almost imagine that there are pine needles floating in the beer.  However, I wouldn't go to the lengths that some people do to get it, especially since there's a VERY limited window where Heady is at its peak freshness."
"Heady Topper","G_d bless the alchemist."
"Heady Topper","I do not think this is the best in the world at all, unless you like your DIPA very sweet."
"Heady Topper","All the hype is annoying, but unlike most highly hyped things, Heady Topper deserves every bit of the praise.  Excellent DIPA, sets the bar high."
"Heady Topper","OVERRATED!!! Not even in my top 10 IPA's."
"Heady Topper","Very enjoyable.  Great hop flavor and aroma."
"Heady Topper","Almost all 5's across the board. Bright, juicy hop flavor. If I could get my hands on this one all the time it would be in my fridge for sure.  Do I think it deserves the #1 spot? Probably not... But it's for sure up there with some of the best of the style I have had (perhaps top 3 or so). Very tasty beer, well made."
"Heady Topper","Almost untouchable in every facet. "
"Heady Topper","Four pack from a trade. Amazingly balanced, neck and neck with Keene Idea and Pliny as my fav IPA..."
"Heady Topper","Great floral taste and smell. Beautiful bitter, hoppy-ness without being overpowering. Extremely smooth."
"Heady Topper","Citrusy and piney. Not quite as malty as some other IPAs that I've had, but probably one of the best IPAs I've ever enjoyed. Would love to taste blind next to Pliny."
"Heady Topper","Three week old can and poured into a long stemmed tulip glass."
"Heady Topper","Good as always. Worth the effort"
"Heady Topper","I couldn't score the look a 5. It's in a can."
"Heady Topper","A blast of flavor.  Great hop forward taste.  Lived up to hype"
"Heady Topper","Decent beer. I'm on the westcoast and know PtE and HT to hand for hand but after finally trying it'll be trading identical beers. HT has more floral on the nose than PtE's nutty aroma. HT was more Hoppy than PtE IMO but not more harsh on the swallow. Overall I like PtE slightly better"
"Heady Topper","As soon as I poured it, the aroma was intense. Hops, some tropical notes, some pine. Nice mouthfeel and intense flavor. Happy to say it lived up to my high expectations."
"Heady Topper","This beer is absolutely delicious, and the smell is unreal.  Very difficult to acquire but isn't too expensive if you can find it, and well worth the attempt if you find yourself in the area!"
"Heady Topper","Pours opaque in its cloudiness. Bright amber with a small head. The smell will punch you in the face with hops. You KNOW it's a good beer when you open the can and the aroma begins to fill the room. The taste is absurdly hoppy. It's literal hop juice. So many levels at once: juicy, bitter, piney, grassy, dank. It's all there. This is a raw and unabated DIPA. A once in a lifetime experience for folks outside of New England. Try it and you will understand its love. Good luck topping the Topper."
"Heady Topper","No date of freshness on the can, approximately it was canned two month ago. "
"Heady Topper","Appearance - hazy golden liquid with white head"
"Heady Topper","Had this beer at a restaurant in Stowe, VT on a recommendation from the server.  Thought it was one of the best IPA's I had ever tasted.  The hop flavor hits you in waves as you drink the beer, very flavorful."
"Heady Topper","Really great ipa very well rounded with a unique finish that disappears of the ol taste buds"
"Heady Topper","So flavorful it satisfied a hop head llike me.  So well rounded and balanced it's pleasing to a weakling like my wife."
"Heady Topper","L: Can't get much better than an unfiltered, filthy looking IPA. "
"Heady Topper","incredible smell with an even better taste"
"Heady Topper","A friend brought back two cans from Vermont a couple weeks ago.  Drank some from the can and it wasn't doing it for me.  Poured the rest in the glass.  Nice hazy amber.  Aroma and mouthfeel were nicer from a glass.  Very drinkable. Not one of those beers that I say, ""Whoa!  Now that's good."" After drinking, I came to believe that these reviews may be somewhat skewed by the beer's high alcohol content.  I liked it better at the end when I was buzzed."
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy golden orange color. The nose contains citrus fruits, pine and some breadiness. The taste is really well balanced and juicy. A really soft bitterness fades quickly on the dry finish."
"Heady Topper","Had this at a small pub in Stowe last summer on vacation. Didn't go looking for it, just fell in to my lap. Best I ever drank. Incredibly smooth. Rated the look only because its mandatory. This went right from the can to my mouth so I never really got a look at it."
"Heady Topper","Gold in color, hazy, clingy white head sticks to the glass."
"Heady Topper","Great beer. There are some other beers out there that I enjoy a little more, but this is definitely worth drinking if you are afforded the opportunity."
"Heady Topper","Definitely lives up to the hype"
"Heady Topper","Look - Light and inviting, golden yellow with a slight amount of murkiness"
"Heady Topper","First tried this last summer, dutifully out of the can. This time, I poured it. It pours a very, and surprisingly, murky yellowish-orange hue. Plenty of pine and floral scents in the aroma. If chilled before drinking, which this can was, there seems to be a slight carbonated bite to the initial feel, which is at first, and to the last, solid-bodied. Taste is nice and piney, with a tinge of bitterness and an even slighter near white wine tang at the end. I poured this into a pint glass, and this settled into itself two-thirds of the way through--good head and a nice syrupy taste developed. I enjoyed the overall drink. It didn't quite measure up to the intense hype, but still an enjoyable brew."
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can (against instruction!) Into a wine glass."
"Heady Topper","I had this at least a couple of weeks old, would love to give a few day old a shot. Unlike other epic DIPAs, this had a more grassy dankness rather than a juicy one. It almost felt like the taste profile is grassy/earthy based (in a good way) rather than juicy/citrusy/fruity based like Maine Dinner or Carton 077xx. "
"Heady Topper","What is there to say about this beer that already hasn't been said. The smell is tropical citrus goodness. Could drink this beer all day long. Absolutely world class."
"Heady Topper","A very nice DIPA, though not mind-blowing like the rumor mill would suggest. I think it's particularly popular because it doesn't blow your mouth's sides out with hops - this is more influenced by English-style beers, and it shows. Very well done."
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed mostly from the can, but with some poured into a 4oz Sierra Nevada tulip pint style tasting glass"
"Heady Topper","this is a great beer that i tasted while visiting Boston area in dec.14... it could be the number one beer but i am waiting to give it a taste test with Santa Fe Pivitol ipa (two hoppers in my ref.)"
"Heady Topper","Hype worthy! Will stay on my wants list."
"Heady Topper","Very tasty layered IPA. Hard to get here in SD but I was able to trade for it. Piny floral notes up front with a nice smooth cirus finish."
"Heady Topper","I live close enough in MA to have had this beer a little over 100 times now.  Each time it does not disappoint.  Smell, flavor, just the right amount of bite.  The DIPA all others are compared to for good reason."
"Heady Topper","Creamy, balanced....easy drinkin' IPA"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can as advised, to say the least this was a phenomenal DIPA. And to be honest it was exactly what I expected it to be. Wether or not it belongs at the number 1 spot is not for me to decide but it is a great beer defiantly worth a try! Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Traveled 200+ miles to buy this beer even before tasting it. Once the first sip touched my lips and trickled down my throat i knew what i had just tasted was greatness. The after taste is literally thirst quenching, by far the best IPA ive ever had, and to top it off its a double IPA! yet soo smooth. Anyways, the fruity smell and perfect amount of hoppy taste followed by a smooth after taste is next to none. Highly recommend this beer!"
"Heady Topper","An absolutely amazing beer. The Double IPA on this beer tastes like no other. I am in NY and my friend brought me back a can from Vermont. All I can say is you really need to try this brew because it is completely unique and tastes like none other."
"Heady Topper","Straight from the can. Purchased today in Burlington."
"Heady Topper","I had two of these within 3 days. I drank from the can as recommended(therefore the color is rated lower). However it is a strange recommendation as it limits the possibility to smell the beer. It is a very hoppy beer with a strong citrus feel. It is slightly too high in alcohol as you can feel it almost immediately but I guess it is normal for a double IPA. Cannot see the date on the cans but bought one from Skinny Pancake in Montpelier and the other from the farmhouse tap and grill in Burlington, which I strongly recommend for their beer selection and food."
"Heady Topper","Hadn't had Heady in about year and a half. Since then I have tried a plethora of new amazing beers from up and coming breweries, like TreeHouse and Trillium, which made me wonder if I still liked Heady just as much as I used to. I was able to score a can last week and had it yesterday for my birthday. To my surprise, it still lives up to its hype! It might not be my favorite DIPA anymore, but it is definitely up there in the top 5."
"Heady Topper","Only beer ever that made my whole body tingle after a few sips. Somehow hits you on the chin, although not extremely strong, but at the same time has a long lasting, complex feel. I'm not articulate in the sommelier language, more like ""this be real good, gotta stock cave"" kinda guy: in my way I recommend it without hesitation. Travelling to  Vermont over the Memorial Day weekend I planned on buying it because of the hype (I live in Massachusetts where it's not available) and stood in a line for nearly 3 hours to get a 24-can case. Time well spent."
"Heady Topper","Such a great tasting beer"
"Heady Topper","Let me start out by saying I'm not a lover of very hoppy beers - so going into this was interesting as I knew it would be high on hops -- but there is also the whole ""trying to even get your hands on this"" mystique that made me need to try it?!"
"Heady Topper","Hard to believe that it was five years ago this week that I graduated from Columbia. It was not easy for me while I was there and the time since could have been kinder to me as well. I got to march earlier this week with the other alums and since I didn't want (or get) any gifts for graduation, a can of this that I traded for up at the Cloverleaf was all I wanted as a gift. Never before was I so excited to have a beer given the lofty ranking of this on here and even though it wasn't quite a ""5"" in my book, I can easily see why so many people on here enjoy this!"
"Heady Topper","Plenty of hoppy goodness.  Drank from the can as instructed, but had to get a look at this beauty so I poured a little in a glass.  It was cloudy and the mouthfeel was defintely not thin.  Very impressed, the aroma was amazing."
"Heady Topper","Had to try it being a local of the area and having easy access to the brewery. I don't believe I am personally experienced enough to fully appreciate/enjoy this beer but It wasn't terrible. Looks and smells FANTASTIC!!!! There were too many flavors hitting me all at once for me to really enjoy it but after the tour, I saw how much thought and effort goes  into making it. Definitely one of the best beers out there it was just hard for me to enjoy personally. I highly recommend for the experienced beer drinkers :D"
"Heady Topper","Awesome beer, but not balanced enough."
"Heady Topper","Super hoppy, super good. Part of the fun is the adventure up to VT and how hard it is to get your paws on it - but gotta love that this is always soo worth it."
"Heady Topper","Just ok...possible I got an older can. No date listed anywhere I could see."
"Heady Topper","This beer lived up to its reputation for me. It was the perfect compliment to the meal."
"Heady Topper","Could be the perfect beer. String hops and grapefruit tones.  Amazing smell and a strong finish."
"Heady Topper","Not a big IPA fan in general but a friend happened to bring some to a party.  Very citrusy aroma.  For taste the bitterness was not overpowering which I expected (not being an experienced IPA DIPA drinker) .  I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the pine and citrus together.  I will begin to try more IPAs because of this but from the few I've had, this is easily the best tasting and most enjoyable."
"Heady Topper","First time having this beer in three years. Found one for trade that I am sure is fresh. "
"Heady Topper","In all honesty this beer is #1 for a reason, hype alone it's still the most complex beer that i've ever had. In one sip it goes from citrus bomb to dank, back to citrus and then finishes dry with pine like hops. So many flavors and the hop aroma smell should be a scented candle! The only beer to come close, complex wise is ""SWISH"" by Bissell Brothers!"
"Heady Topper","I live in Bridlington vt and would call this brew no more than a fad. I've had people I don't even know (friend of a friend) hit me up just to help them get an extra case to bring home wIth them to New York. It's good, yeah, perhaps my pallet is discerning, but I'd love to see something new from the alchemist or hill farmstead uproot this silly phase"
"Heady Topper","Damn good. Pulls it all off despite Everest expectations."
"Heady Topper","Solid beer, but the best?  I think others are better.  That said, I won't turn these down."
"Heady Topper","I had a few cans recently and the quality of this beer went down.  Last year's production was delicious and hoppy.  This year tasted like a unfresh malt bomb."
"Heady Topper","Pours an opaque lemon yellow color with a huge fluffy bright white head.  Lemon, celery and cucumber with a bit of pine on the nose.  Taste is bright and lemony up front with a juniper hop bitterness on the back."
"Heady Topper","Wow. As good as ranked and expected"
"Heady Topper","Mouthfuls of fluffy hoppiness.  Super smooth and delicious.  It's more hoppy than words can describe, and yet, not too much so.  Worth drinking every chance you can get your hands on it."
"Heady Topper","wave after wave of hops! i drove 200 miles for this beer. it did not disappoint."
"Heady Topper","Good to have a Vermont connection."
"Heady Topper","""Look""??? Suppose to drink it from the can....I'm trusting it looks great"
"Heady Topper","unbelievable. it met all expectations however inflated I thought they might be!"
"Heady Topper","After hearing the hype surrounding this beer, I went on an adventure to obtain it in upstate Vermont. After taking off a day from work, I traveled almost 4 hours to hop in the lines at the venues where this was being delivered that Thursday. I was accompanied by a whole bunch of craft beer lovers. Without disappointment, I was able to obtain several cases of this elusive gem! Following directions, I drank this straight from the can and what a surprise it was... by far one of the best double IPAs in the country. I can realistically see why this beer is so sought after. If you haven't already, do your best to obtain a fresh can of this beer... it will change your thoughts about craft beer. Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Delicious.  If I fall into some more I will happily drink it, but probably not differentiated enough from readily available double IPAs to make the hassle worth it."
"Heady Topper","This beer changed my life. It changed what I thought about beer and what a hoppy beer could be. There are several other great DIPAs that rival it (Second Fiddle, Dbl Sunshine, Pliny, ...) but Heady has a special place in my heart."
"Heady Topper","Nice orange juice flavor, balanced sweetness and bitterness."
"Heady Topper","I was honestly hoping that this beer was too hyped, but boy was I wrong!"
"Heady Topper","Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a tulip. No canned on date, but picked this up recently in a trade and was told it's ""as fresh as can be"", so I'm assuming no more than 2-3 weeks old at this point. "
"Heady Topper","Admittedly, I'm not a huge DIPA guy, but I don't get it. Cloudy and not as smooth as I thought it would be. Aftertaste lingers forever. Not horrible but I expected much more."
"Heady Topper","The beer I judge all by."
"Heady Topper","Good but wasn't blown away"
"Heady Topper","Just untouchable. Must be the water in Vermont."
"Heady Topper","Drove up to Barre, VT to pick up a case to bring to my Dad in Mississippi--retiring after 39 years teaching. And this beer is as good as they say."
"Heady Topper","First, thanks to the nameless one in Vista for the can I got to share with my girlfriend, I got to try Heady without having to either trade for it or go to Vermont. :) I have had so many wonderful DIPAs that I knew right from the first sip that nothing would shock me with greatness ever again; but drinking this beer, I could definitely understand why it's (currently) the top rated beer. "
"Heady Topper","Lives up to the hype...excellent DIPA"
"Heady Topper","Let me begin with a precursor: I've had Heady on several occasions, my first being almost four years ago. I'm writing this review because this batch from early February when I purchased a case is simply a shell of its former self and must have something wrong with it (and not because it's been 3 months since it was canned; because it tasted the same right after I bought it and it's been refrigerated ever since and should still be plenty drinkable at this stage). Cracking a can brings an overwhelming smell and subsequent taste of peanut butter, peanut oil and peanuts. As I am not a homebrewer, though I work in beer retail, I do not know how to pinpoint this off-flavor/smell (i.e. diacetyl), but it is certainly not the Heady that blew my mind when I first had it four years ago. My main motivation in writing this review is to alert others to the possibility that clearly not all batches of Heady are created equal now. If this can be chalked up to mishandling (exposure to heat), and is not a fault of The Alchemist, I would certainly understand. But as I purchased this case in the midst of a bone-chilling winter, I find that possibility not very plausible. And don't get me wrong; this is not intended to throw The Alchemist, John and Jen or their staff under the bus. They are working tirelessly to bring this beer to the masses of VT, the U.S., and now--yes--the world. Hopefully this is simply an anomaly and their quality control only improves with further batches, yet now with their increased production and the new Stowe facility, this may only become more difficult in the future. As a die-hard craft drinker and one who knows where Heady belongs in the upper echelon of DIPAs, I hope this does not prove to be the case."
"Heady Topper","Absolutely delicious IPA. Incredibly well balanced while still juicy (lots of tropical notes) and a great hoppy finish that lingers w a citric bitterness. Love this beer."
"Heady Topper","I make trips frequently to northern Vermont and I always search for this beautiful creation in a can. I'm very happy about the breweries newest adventure with their beer room facilities opening soon."
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into a stemless Heady Topper glass"
"Heady Topper","Picked up case max last Tuesday while looking for Sip Of Sunshine.  Great drinkability and balance.  As I have heard, the flavor does change as you move through the layers.  Hop flavor and bitterness come at you from all different angles."
"Heady Topper","Hard to find, but definitely worth the wait. Nothing but greatness!"
"Heady Topper","This was such a let down. I've had almost every beer on the top 250 list and I can name 10 beers that are better than this one. Womp."
"Heady Topper","Dry, bitter, slightly sticky. Definitely good but definitely not worth freaking out over."
"Heady Topper","I never get tired of this beer. It's one of the fluffiest DIPAs ever with such a wonderful punch of hops that linger. The finish is super clean and leaves you dying for another sip. Too bad it's such a pain to get :)"
"Heady Topper","Revived a 4 pack from a trade. "
"Heady Topper","5's all across the board. Best smelling, tasting and finishing beer. I have ever had."
"Heady Topper","Can poured into glass I'm almost positive that they tell you to drink it in the can because In a glass it does not look so great but in this case looks are definitely deceiving nice tropical fruit aromas that also come through in the flavor with a nice bitter hoppy finish outstanding ipa that lives up to the hype"
"Heady Topper","Can't find flaws in this one, or too many better double IPAs for that matter. There are better, but they are few and far between. There's really nothing negative to say - the look, smell, taste, feel, and whatever else you care about are damn near perfect. It's not the best beer I have ever had but it's pretty damn close"
"Heady Topper","I finally got to try this thanks to a coworker who got some in a trade. I drank it from the can as directed. It was very good, however, I feel this beer should not still be at #1. I had Pliny the Elder a week ago and liked it a lot more. But, fwiw, I think I like FW Double Jack more than this, so do what you will with this review."
"Heady Topper","What can I say, awesome piny hop nose, just keeps coming at you.  sweet malty start then just a dank hop explosion on the tongue.  Outstanding beer."
"Heady Topper","At this point, reviewing Heady Topper is analogous to rating the character of Derek Jeter.  Everything great has been said, everything said has been great, and that standard is not going away. So, we are no longer worthy of trying to compare this IPA to anything else on the market. A reviewer below writes that although Heady is ""an incredible IPA, there are others equally as good."" I think they are claiming that there is no better beer being brewed in the world right now, than what is being produced here in the US. I almost completely agree.  The only exception is maybe Belgium, and their exotic ales, however, Brewery Ommegang has made the gap very small these days.  Anyway, USA is killing it, and the beer buffet out there has something great for everyone.  The only criticism of the referenced blog below would be that a reader could get the impression that they were placing Heady head-to-head with the likes of Rogue Dead Guy Ale. That would be like comparing an 18 year aged cheddar to light orange ballpark nacho melt. Not that there is anything wrong with either.  We all have our favorites, and it's nice that the writer below is proud and loyal to the other great beers out there, and publishes their support. This makes the world go round, and keeps all of these committed brewers thriving. I enjoy them all too."
"Heady Topper","The benchmark everything else.  Truly in a class of it's own."
"Heady Topper","Quick review.  There's nothing I can say here that hasn't already been said.  This brew is a classic for a reason, one of the very best IPA offerings that I've tasted."
"Heady Topper","Simply the greatest IPA on the market.  Only bummer is that even though I live in West Rutland, VT, I have drive north to find it as well as making sure I hit the store at the right time.  All in all, it's worth the drive and the wait.  This beer is definitely worth the top of the list rating it enjoys."
"Heady Topper","This is an incredible IPA. I am not sure it's worth the hype. There are others that are just as good. Dogfish Head 90 Minute, Wachusetts Larry, Bells Two Hearted,  Rogue Dead Guy Ale, ADK Super Dort and Foley Brothers Fair Maiden are all equally good. Hard to tell for certain which is best. They are all good in there own right."
"Heady Topper","Not really an IPA guy but it was by far the best IPA I have had. Great hoppy taste at beginning with a smoothe finish."
"Heady Topper","My buddy gave me this beer when I got back form Texas back in November 2014. This is an amazing DIPA. Amazing crisp taste with hints of citrus, orange, and grapefruit. Left me wanting more! I need to visit Vermont and grab me some Heady!"
"Heady Topper","Not as good as i was expecting.  Could use a bit more balance on the back end.  Overall a juicy thick great beer."
"Heady Topper","Ahhmazing. Used to live in Mass and made a trade with a friend from VT for Pliny the Elder"
"Heady Topper","This is an exceptional beer.  Even friends who are not big fans of IPAs respect this beer for its nuance and complexity.  This is really an outstanding achievement in beer making and a beer that I will enjoy at any opportunity.  I've already done the road trip to norther Vermont a few times now and will do again."
"Heady Topper","This beer is perfection in a can. From the initial hoppy ""kick"" to the face. The taste slowly mellows out as the can empties. At the end you feel very very satisfied and slightly buzzed from the 8%."
"Heady Topper","2 words to describe this one.......none better!"
"Heady Topper","This beer is like no other."
"Heady Topper","Great balanced DIPA! It is certainly better in the can. I will definitely try to find more."
"Heady Topper","Great smell of pine and grassy hops. Actually does taste better from the can! Great fresh bitter taste, citrus, exotic fruits, drank it when it was only 2 weeks old, probably the freshest I can get here in the Netherlands."
"Heady Topper","Probably the greatest beer I've ever had the privilege of drinking"
"Heady Topper","Another personal favorite, can't get enough of this beer"
"Heady Topper","I'm 14 oz. into my first Heady Topper."
"Heady Topper","Palate-pleasing. Received as a gift for its difficulty to obtain. Now I know why."
"Heady Topper","Flawless. I don't buy into hype. I didn't buy the hype on this. Heady might be the perfect beer. Looking forward to a future road trip to Vermont to scope some out!!!"
"Heady Topper","Wow, definitely lived up to the hype for me. Bold hoppiness but with a citrus and almost pineapple fresh flavor complexity that was truly delicious."
"Heady Topper","A very well balanced IPA. Drink fresh and enjoy it, if you can find it."
"Heady Topper","Sorry guys, the smell was good but I just do not like IPAs. I need some other flavor and after taste besides bitter hops. It wasnt smooth at all. ABV isnt noticeable though."
"Heady Topper","World class DIPA. Undoubtedly. Citrus, crisp, bitter, smooth. The aroma is right on par with the unreal taste - it's a blast of citrus, pine and pith that hovers around the can. I'm a fan of drinking straight from the can but no harm is wrought if it's poured into a  glass. So many in-depth reviews on here so I'll be brief - big body with a soft mouthfeel supplemented by an entirely unique cascade of citrus, pine and bitter-hop flavors. The bouquet of apricot, orange rind, lemon, grapefruit, crackery malt, tobacco and tea hits hard up front then proceeds to coat the mouth and linger for a few seconds after the sip. Gorgeous. Nothing like it."
"Heady Topper","One of the most complex flavors I've ever had. I get something different with every taste. High alcohol content goes almost unnoticed. No beer I've ever had is anything like this."
"Heady Topper","So crisp and fresh for an IPA"
"Heady Topper","Great beer.  Lived up to the hype for me."
"Heady Topper","Definitely lived up to the hype. Mouthfeel wasn't quite as crisp as I like, but just my personal preference. Excellent beer."
"Heady Topper","This beer pours a hazy bright yellow golden color with a huge, frothy bright white head. Retention is excellent with a one finger cap lasting the entire beer and many chunky hanging sheets of lacing. Smell is a citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, and a slight bit of dankness pine are all present. Taste is the same with just moderate amount of bitterness. Feel is very soft at first with a prickly bitterness on the back end. Overall a very good beer."
"Heady Topper","One of the best doubles. Complex. Enjoy every sip"
"Heady Topper","Single best nose ever for me. Worthy of all the Hype. Had it fresh side by side with Zombie Dust - different style but still a top 10 beer for me, and Heady killed it. Just super impressive."
"Heady Topper","An amazing double ipa can't get much better than this"
"Heady Topper","Not even the best beer in Vermont."
"Heady Topper","Look: Poured the can into a tulip glass. Fluffy head with a lot of bubbles. Gold and murky."
"Heady Topper","After all the hype, I expected more....too much?  Pretty much like drinking grapefruit juice.  I also question the instructions to drink from the can, a good beer should be able to be appreciated from a glass."
"Heady Topper","I never heard of this beer until someone plopped a fresh cold unopened can down in front of me. My first thought was I love the graphics and the name. But i was a little apprehensive to drinking it from the can. But holy hell were the contents of that can just marvelous. My favorite thing was the aftertaste. Savoring each moment between sips, I found myself sipping just to recharge that taste. Man, this beer was just AMAZING. If you can someway get your hands on it. Drink the living shit out of it."
"Heady Topper","Vey complex flavors. Goes down smooth for a 2X IPA. Can't have enough when I have it once a year."
"Heady Topper","Was lucky enough to try fresh Heady.  Perhaps its all the talk or maybe it is all the beer that is available now, but I like others much better.  This is a great beer just not one I would search out.  I am very glad I had the chance to try it and would encourage others to do so as the beauty of beer is everyone has a different palate and even that changes over time."
"Heady Topper","Great smell. Lots of citrus, some pepper and lots of hops!  Very enjoyable!"
"Heady Topper","It's a beautiful beer. Amazing"
"Heady Topper","Is it a very good beer?   100% yes. "
"Heady Topper","super crushable yet complex, will see out more in the future. How does such a small state have such incredible breweries I ask?"
"Heady Topper","I'm a Vermonter.  I love Vermont and the beer we have to offer.  I would share this beer with whoever would like a taste of what we have to offer as a small state with some of the best breweries in the country."
"Heady Topper","Wow, simply amazing. It is insane how easy this is to consume for being a DIPA."
"Heady Topper","How many hops can you cram into a can yet still make it well balanced and insanely crushable?  Pretty much the gold standard of ipas.  I've tried it in every kind of glassware imaginable but enjoy heady so much more right out of the can."
"Heady Topper","Amazing beer. Lucky to have someone next to the brewery.. Haha fresh heady all the time"
"Heady Topper","Hands down the Best Beer I've ever drank"
"Heady Topper","Look: The can looks awesome when you can see it. Unfortunately every time I go to Vermont I see an empty space where this beer is supposed to be. Why does everyone want this stuff so bad? Let me explain."
"Heady Topper","Amazing beer. Hops for days.  Drink it from the can! 99/100"
"Heady Topper","Had it many times still my all time favorite...."
"Heady Topper","If you're into IPAs, this is the beer for you. Drink from the can, as soon as you open the smell hits hard; Intense hops. Taste is just like the smell, punches you in the face with the hops. With the high IBU rating it's not a surprise. Easy to drink, but stay away from too many as you'll get numb from the flavor."
"Heady Topper","This is an exceptional beer. As instructed on the can, I drank it out of the can. It was delicious. For my second one, I opted to drink it out the glass. I would recommend the glass."
"Heady Topper","Lives up to the hype pretty well!"
"Heady Topper","I am sorry!!! the Beer is cloudy as hell and better in the can. However, i came from around the world and have been Homebrewing for 8 years; just to drive countless hours and wait in line; only to take a sip of the worlds finest! Yes, it lives to its standards! I e-mailed the company and all the stores to assure myself and acquire some of this brew! I got turned down by both saying to follow the truck and wait in line. I did and popped my first can at Route 7 in Shelburne VT at 945 in the morning to find the LOve of my IPA's!! A very balanced and strong double IPA leaving resigns of pine flavor in my mouth many minutes after drinking. 5 out of 5 for sure and still to this day worth the wait as i did on 30-March-2015 at Route 7 in Shelburne VT. Thank you, I will do this again just to get a case. Chris"
"Heady Topper","The best beer in existence."
"Heady Topper","Pretty much the perfect beer!  Hops are slammed into this can and the smoothness is undeniable.  Wish I could get it more but am so grateful to those kind enough to let me try it.  Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","A treat every time I get to have one."
"Heady Topper","One of the best beers I've ever had!"
"Heady Topper","As good ad advertised. Poured out of the can into glasses because I wanted to see what a legend looks like. Really excellent. We are living in the golden age of brewing. Enjoy."
"Heady Topper","Fantastic IPA. Totally solid. Hype-worthy."
"Heady Topper","Exceptional dgipa from the alchemist."
"Heady Topper","I obeyed and drank straight from the can. spritzy, splash of citrus. hoppy and toppy.  T slight grapefruit. F all other beers. Overall ... As good as people said I think it should taste. I love what reviews tell me to love and this is DEFINATELY one the worst spellings of definitely out there. I believe Heady Topper is not alone at the top though as, in my opinion, other people have told me that other beers compete."
"Heady Topper","I disobeyed and poured into glass. L golden and hazy.  S piney and hoppy.  T slight citrus and sweet.  F smooth and balanced. Overall ... As good as advertised. I love DIPA's and this is DEFINATELY one of the best. I believe Heady Topper is not alone at the top though as, in my opinion, Gandhi Bot and Sip of Sunshine are also in the same class."
"Heady Topper","Was very happy to grab a few when i could. Sadly it didnt live up to what i was expecting. i guess it's all the hype on it being so limited in availability. Overall its a solid IPA just not the BEST AROUND... in my opinion."
"Heady Topper","A friend from Vermont hooked it up and brought a few cans over."
"Heady Topper","Just got back from Vermont on a one day beercation. Got a case of topper at the beverage baron. 2 four packs at another store down the street and two more 4 packs in Burlington. Nice dank aroma. Hop forward with tropical hints. Very smooth mouth feel."
"Heady Topper","Over ten thousand beer geeks have rated Heady # 1  for the past 2 yrs. strong. Cheers  to us!"
"Heady Topper","One of the best IPA's (imo). I had to pour a little in a glass just to look at the color and it's a beautiful looking beer as well. I will always get a trade together to get a hold of some of this. Cheers."
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from can so I assume it looks as good as it tastes. Very hoppy with full pine/resin hop flavor. Good malt backbone which makes the flavor even more complex. Taste is best as the can warms slightly. Amazing beer"
"Heady Topper","16oz can.  No canning date, but reportedly fresh.  I don't do well at following instructions so I poured it into a tulip"
"Heady Topper","It was great, but not my favorite ever..."
"Heady Topper","Going in depth on this beer doesn't feel necessary, suffice to say it is after several years of narrowing down the IPA field, it is my favorite DIPA and favorite beer. I'm a native vermonter who doesn't have regular access to this anymore, so perhaps I will do a full detailed review when I next have a fresh can."
"Heady Topper","Had a Heady Topper. It was the best Hoppy beer I have ever had. I water picked, flossed, and brushed my teeth. I went to bed. I burped in my sleep. I awoke to Christmas in my mouth. It left a lasting impression. I'd love another Heady and will seek one out!"
"Heady Topper","With all the hype, I was skeptical.  It really measured up.   Unfiltered golden color.  Volumes of citrusy hop flavor.  Long, rich finish.  Despite an abv 8% it hours it well.  Great beer, no other words for it."
"Heady Topper","Amazing!!! Want more...but only available in vt!!! The anticipation makes it better"
"Heady Topper","The Elusive Heady Topper... The beer no one can get unless you have knowledge from the locals. This winter I trekked up to Waterbury VT to do some skiing with my gf in nearby Stowe. We knew about this beer prior to the trip but didn't realize just how rare and difficult it was to track down. Shops in Waterbury who stock the brew have special stickers on their doors that designate them as authorized retailers. Can you believe that? It's like an Apple product!"
"Heady Topper","Can drank from can with 2 oz poured into snifter for appearance rating"
"Heady Topper","Was a solid beer that I could drink again, but certainly isn't one of the top beers I've had."
"Heady Topper","I got two cans via recent IP trade and my understanding is that they were roughly one month old.  The first can I opened was not good at all.  The second can was like night and day!  Really enjoyed the citrusy hops smell.  Just not sure this is the #1 beer in the world IMO.  If anything I'd like to try some really fresh stuff and see how it compares."
"Heady Topper","Good good god good good"
"Heady Topper","great can, smell off the charts, taste is a never ending hop bomb and feel lasts forever.  Overall it is worth the hype"
"Heady Topper","The hype is real. It's like a hop stew, coating your mouth and leaving an amazing, sticky, resinous, thick hop afterbuzz. I always enjoy from a glass, and it never dissapoints."
"Heady Topper","Good taste. Strong to strong."
"Heady Topper","A - More yellow-gold than other DIPAs. Not too much of a head. Nice lacing."
"Heady Topper","Bought a 4 pack while driving through Vermont.  Solid IPA but certainly not the best beer in the world.  I don't get the hype."
"Heady Topper","If you ever have a chance to have this....DO!"
"Heady Topper","Nothing less than excellent. My #2 overall beverage."
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy bright orange with a thick soapy white head. The smell hits with a floral quality but you will get some tropical fruit notes if you really dig your nose in; pineapple, mango, melon, a bit of juicey orange, and a touch of sweetness. That sweetness comes through even more on the taste, almost honey or brown sugar-like, not really your typical malt sweetness. There is some mild fruitiness again, I'd say the best descriptor is ripe cantaloupe but there is some melon, guava, and papaya in there as well. Mouthfeel is soft and sticky, not too much bitterness, the sweetness lingers. Definitely hides the 8% ABV well."
"Heady Topper","Drank this beer straight from the can.  Aromas of grapefruit, tropical fruit, pomegranate, mango, kiwi, oranges, pine.  Taste is wave after wave of hops.  Tropical fruits upfront followed by a piney resinous bitterness on the back.  Medium body, carbonation is moderate, extremely refreshing at 8.0% abv.  "
"Heady Topper","I love a good hoppy beer and this one is delicious."
"Heady Topper","seriously the best tasting beer i've ever had"
"Heady Topper","Straight up hops mishmash, not much more going on - certainly not what I would call a balanced brew. Artificial rarity factor keeps prices high. I've had plenty of DIPA""s that I liked better than this one. Not to say it's not good, but the price is insane. Aroma: hops, hops and more hops. Taste: Hops, hops and more hops."
"Heady Topper","Before I go further with this review let me make two caveats:  First, the three times I received a can of this brew was from people who traveled to get it, so I don't know how it was kept for the days or weeks before it got to me.  Second, I'm not trying to topple a giant, Just trying to give an honest review while trying to follow BJCP guidelines and not let public hype influence my observations...  Anywho, let's drink some Heady Topper!!!  "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is absolutely lives up to the hype is is one of the world class IPAs without question. Fresh resinous hops with tons of flavor. What is not to love. Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","NOT the best Vermont double IPA."
"Heady Topper","Unequivocal, exceptional, renowned, incomparable, in league of its own"
"Heady Topper","For me, it lived up to the hype! Juicy hop layers accentuated by strong malt backbone. Deliciousness, straight from the can!"
"Heady Topper","This beer recently came through Philly and caused a sensation ! Hope to see more of it. Recommend drinking it straight from the can, as the owner suggests in his video clip. Many thanks to Vermont for an excellent American Double/ Imperial IPA."
"Heady Topper","A gift from regular customers, sweeeeeet."
"Heady Topper","Good brew but a little overrated"
"Heady Topper","This is my first BA review, but it's definitely not my first beer.  I got lucky and went to Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia in search of Pliny the Elder and found out that they were serving Heady Topper.  The line for the beer went out the door.  It lived up to the hype in a big way.  Everything about this beer was phenomenal.  The first sip was almost magical.  Like the beer was massaging my tongue.  Every sip after that got better and better.  The only disappointment was when I realized my can was empty.  Perfect beer."
"Heady Topper","This beer is great... but a little too much hop/bitterness on the finish. Have drank out of can, tulip, and wide mouth. Great smell and look... but not as smooth as I hoped. A bit overrated with the new era of imperials... there are a lot out there that are going to give HT a run for the top spot in the next 12-18 months if production from these micros can get up to speed with demand."
"Heady Topper","A few sips in a tulip, majority from the can.  Color is slightly opaque gold.  It really is very smooth for a double IPA.  Nice hoppiness without just being punch-you-in-the-face bitter.  Mouthfeel is really nice; creamy foam, not too carbonated.  "
"Heady Topper","Not that great. With exclusivity comes high ratings"
"Heady Topper","Honestly, I have either received two of the worst cans in the history of mankind, possibly infected, who knows but let's be honest, I tried this once before Sip of Sunshine and Once the following day after drinking Sip of Sunshine. The absolute worst double IPA I have ever had, and this is my favorite style!"
"Heady Topper","Had a can today at City Tap House (Logan Sq). Drank most of it from the can. Poured off about 4 oz into a taster glass."
"Heady Topper","Can served directly at a release (I assume quite fresh). "
"Heady Topper","Anything in a can gets a Look 5. Philly Welcome Gig at Monk's. Two cans (just to be sure).  John was here, but appeared to be busy. I've said ""get some"" before, but this may be the first time for a brew. Get some."
"Heady Topper","Definitely lives up to the hype. From the first sip, I noticed some very subtle pine and citrus, which developed into this beautiful buttery-toffee finish. It has sort of an organic mouthfeel which I really dig; could be the fact that it is unpasteurized and unfiltered. Just the right about of bitterness and unique hop flavor to make this extremely satisfying. Killer IPA."
"Heady Topper","Hop-Dayum!!!!! This beer is the Bees-Knees."
"Heady Topper","Poured half into a snifter to get a good look at it, left the other half to be consumed from the can as is suggested by The Alchemist."
"Heady Topper","Nice. I wouldn't drink from the can. It has some herbal borderline soupy qualities not fond of. Thick and very full bodied. Lacks citrus. Very crushable but this just lacks all the hoppy fruity qualities I want in a double IPA. It's a good beer but I guess I'm spoiled with west coast ipas. I don't get the hype."
"Heady Topper","A good beer but definitely overrated"
"Heady Topper","Outstanding beer overall.  I enjoy it every time I have it, but it is exceedingly hard to get.  I liked it better when I could pick up a four pack or two at the brewery.  Alas!  No longer!"
"Heady Topper","Wanted my 50th rating to be a good one. Had a good amount of this brew last year but only shared one since. Hard not to rate it as a 5 across the board. Ridiculously drinkable. An honor to partake!"
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into Speigelau glass"
"Heady Topper","Best I've ever tasted. The hops are incredible, but it finishes superbly with no harshness."
"Heady Topper","There is a reason this is #1. What an epic DIPA. Worth the trip, the cost, the everything. Still, remember it is just beer. Some people hype it up to be god in a can. Too much hype can be a bad thing. Still, what an amazing brew. Cheers to The Alchemist!"
"Heady Topper","Poured into a glass."
"Heady Topper","Flavor seems to change as you get through the can."
"Heady Topper","As advertised, one of the greatest beers known to mankind.  It was indeed worth all the trouble and cost it took to get my hands on Heady."
"Heady Topper","Combination of two separate drinkings. Once from the can, once from a snifter on two separate days."
"Heady Topper","This was my first double IPA ever, and it's still the best I've ever had.  Can't wait to try it again."
"Heady Topper","I find it very unique. The only other DIPA similar that I have had that I can think of was Mastermind. Very murky/cloudy. Not overly hoppy or bitter. Somewhat subtle in the flavor department for what I expected, but very, very good. Orange, tropical fruits, herbs, earthy, wine like alcohol. Very crisp bite to it. Similar to Hill Farmstead beers in mouthfeel. Just different. I know, real helpful, but I dont think I can describe it with any justice. "
"Heady Topper","Amazing drink! Tried it with my brother in San Diego.  He was able to get from a coworker that has family in Vermont. Definitely lived up to the hype. "
"Heady Topper","Unbelievable balance. My first thoughts were that it's a fantastic beer with incredible hop flavor, but probably not the best beer in the world. However, now when I drink an IPA I realize everything the Topper was and everything the beer I'm drinking isn't."
"Heady Topper","Soooo damn good. So happy I was able to try it!"
"Heady Topper","Was able to try after a friend visited Vermont.  A beautiful beer visually (I cheated and poured into a Spieglau IPA glass.)  "
"Heady Topper","As good as it gets."
"Heady Topper","Was lucky enough to have this one at Sam Horne's Hop Rodeo. The only bad thing was, this was the ""mystery beer"" and it was consumed after Pliny The Younger. While it was a very good beer, I believe it's slightly over-hyped. I'm a West Coast IPA guy, so that might also be why. This was good, not great. Both Plinys blow this beer out of the water. But, hey, I got to cross this one off my bucket list. Never thought I'd get this on the West Coast, and glad I did."
"Heady Topper","UMMMMMM HEADY.....UMMMMMMM....Give me more. Daddy likes...  The only bad thing is that it comes in a can.  Otherwise, it would be the perfect 5....Just reflecting on my personal biases"
"Heady Topper","The best beer I ever had. Great taste, great buzz."
"Heady Topper","Incredible nose and drinks so smooth. The numbness on my tongue after lingered a little more than I wanted, but either way this is a truly incredible beer."
"Heady Topper","Not sure if Im just jaded by all of these wonderful west coast ipas at my disposal, or if this just doesnt live up to the hype. Either way, it was just ok imo."
"Heady Topper","Amazing beer, but I believe there are many that rival it's flavor, and are much easier to get your hands on."
"Heady Topper","Gives me a reason to travel to northern Vermont or beg some buddies too. Just can't beat heady!"
"Heady Topper","My 600th Beer Advocate review. Enjoyed on my birthday 02/21/15."
"Heady Topper","Unassuming, tasty, a true treat on the palate. Better get in line early if you want some. Many thanks to my great friends who allowed me to indulge in this fantastic offering."
"Heady Topper","hoppy but not too hoppy bitter but not too bitter ..hands down the best beer I've ever had"
"Heady Topper","Amazing.  The best DIPA I have ever tasted.  Even better than Pliny the Elder on tap (but not by much)."
"Heady Topper","Pours a very hazy, cloudy and just plan murky. the color is burnish orange. The head produced was tall with sticky froth that leave plenty of lacing in my glass."
"Heady Topper","Murky golden beer with small head.  Huge burst of hops flavors, lemon zest, pine in extreme amounts. Aggressive and yet highly drinkable. Lived up to the hype."
"Heady Topper","Had out of a can. Drank partially from can and partially from glass. More bite out of the can, but great taste either way. Everything you'd expect an ipa to be....straight fire!"
"Heady Topper","amazing beer !! must drink from the can"
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy orange with two fingers of white head. Big aroma of pineapple, mango, and dank floral notes. Tastes of grapefruit, sweet tropical fruits and then finishes with piney bitterness. Medium mouth with some carbonation. This is such a well-made DIPA."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can, in spite of instructions. Hazy orange, thin head, great aroma. Big, balanced, hoppy. A lovely beer, maybe not the best ever."
"Heady Topper","Drank about a third of the beer from the can as recommended. Appearance, from what I saw from the others who poured theirs into cups, was orange-copper in color and topped with a huge head. The aroma was outstanding, citrus and tropical fruits, lots of pine, a little faint malt. Taste is slightly sweet with orange, pineapple, mango flavors. The bitterness comes mid palate featuring pine, citrus peel, and resin. Medium body, thick texture, moderate carbonation, dry bitter finish. Is it worth the Herculean measures to obtain? Maybe not, but a world-class DIPA."
"Heady Topper","Lived up to the hype and then some. Best dipa I've had which includes PLE, Hopslam, etc."
"Heady Topper","This beer reminds me of fresca for some reason.  It smells great and has a strong citrus taste and a perfect amount of bitterness to it.  "
"Heady Topper","This is a perfect example of why I don't like to include ""look"" in a rating. They tell you to drink this from the can for a reason."
"Heady Topper","Very smooth and well balanced. Definitely a great beer!"
"Heady Topper","I don't think I have rated anything as high as this one. I honestly looked for defects in this as to not let the legacy of the beer sway my review and suck all objectivity out but damn, it really is worth every penny of hype it receives. What I look for in an IPA is balance. Typically when I get into DIPAs, I tend to relax my search for balance as it is typically replaced by too much sweetness or a touch too much heat (and that's in the best DIPAs I've had) The reason I believe that Heady deserves the critical acclaim is that it has re-written the rules so to speak, for me in approaching the DIPA. Yes, it CAN be well balanced and brilliant within the style. This one opens up with a great nose full of citrus AND pine somehow, without overwhelming on either. Taste follows identically until the sweetness in perfect harmony with the perfectly balanced malt backbone join in and combine every sensation together for one, again, very well balanced taste that finished with just a tiny touch of heat that reminds you that it is a DIPA. Full bodied, well balanced, pretty much every superlative that you can find in describing a great experience in drinking a beer belong here."
"Heady Topper","Get my hands on this 1x a month. It's a blessing, this is one great beer, so smoothe and flavors just pop in your mouth. It deserves all of the acclaim, great beer."
"Heady Topper","As close to a perfect IIPA as it gets....had the opportunity to have a couple at a restaurant in Burlington, and they delivered on the hype. Everything that can be said about the aroma, taste, and overall experience of this beer has already been said, but needless to say, it comes through. Its ""world-class"" rating is justified."
"Heady Topper","I am spoiled to live in Vermont and have ready access to Heady. I think, these days, people hear 'Best in the World' and expect an out of body experience or something. This experience is entirely in the can. I'm sure there are other beers that are objectively as good. I doubt there are any better. This beer won't fix our national deficit, make dogs love cats, or bring back Jimi Hendrix. It will, however dance across the palate in an entertaining way. My advice is to open one and enjoy slowly from the can. The entire flavor profile changes as it warms. I am sure many people have tried Heady that was shipped to them. Getting this beer warm is like feeding a wet Mogwai after midnight. I shipped some to myself when I was on assignment in Texas. It was sent on a Saturday and I got it Monday. Was not the same beer I sent when it arrived. For anyone who has had it this way and reviewed it, I really don't think you got it the way it should be. Oh, and about the can vs glass debate... if you drink it slowly the later complexity is seriously diminished when its been poured into a glass."
"Heady Topper","Hard to live up to the hype but still great. "
"Heady Topper","The hype is real."
"Heady Topper","It's been said time and time again that this beer is either the best that's ever been had or exceptionally overrated. I suppose the only way to rate it is to hearken back to my initial thought when I took my first sip-- ""how did they fit all of my favorite flavors in this can?"" It really is great. There are many either great beers that measure up, for sure. However, the more popular it becomes the harsher the ratings get. It is what it is, and that's an amazing beer to be enjoyed, not exalted or compared. It's in good company with many other greats that this country is producing. Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Great beer but this is a litle over hyped."
"Heady Topper","This can may have been old, but I was expecting a lot more."
"Heady Topper","Worth the hype. Doesn't have a floral aroma of some other whalez, mouth feel is nothing special, but the taste is as good as it gets."
"Heady Topper","This beer is quite easy to get in Vermont with some planning and patience. This would fall within my top three DIPA's I have tasted. Has a great smell, color and taste and awesome finish. Not so sure about drinking it out of the can! I just prefer a snifter style glass versus the can. Only thing better than this beer is Patriots winning the Super Bowl!"
"Heady Topper","I broke the rules poured from the can into a pint glass, oh no. First of all this is a really good IPA and I'm glad I drove to Vermont for it. Wonderful piney hop character and solid ABV at 8%. Very smooth too with great aromas and golden color. However I'm not so sure this is really the best IPA in the country. While it's certainly no run of the mill IPA I've had numerous IPAs that would compare to it or even be better. I'll agree with my man coffdaddy in his review, Jai Alai by Cigar City kicks its butt. And the directions were a bit excessive although I've had it from the can as well as a sniffer."
"Heady Topper","I've had 3 cases of this stuff to myself now. It is very good. Being from CA, my comparison point is Pliny. They're next to identical in every way, except appearance. Great beer, better out of the can than in it. If you were blindfolded, it'd be hard to tell the difference between the two. As a person that has been fortunate to acquire so much and share it friends, trust me...it's overrated."
"Heady Topper","Okay, I've had a bunch of Heady since my initial review here. Since that one was less than 150 characters, let's do one tonight that counts. Can is roughly 2 weeks old. Thanks, Theresa! :)"
"Heady Topper","I did the half can/half glass experiment and the can was triumphant per my expectations."
"Heady Topper","I will admit that I consumed this prior to knowing it was rated #1 in the country, and it definitely was the best I've ever had. I caught a nice buzz that sent the endorphins in high gear from head to toe..need to find more of this."
"Heady Topper","what an amazing beer starts off with flavors of pine very very piney and then out of nowhere comes a huge grapefruit presence and is very smooth such a great great beer Thank You alchemist you are amazing"
"Heady Topper","its good, its hoppy but has less of a harsh hop finish. typical grapefruity hop profile but nicer finish. i like ipa's but don't love them. higher carbonation which i believe is increased because you have to drink from the can...so i poured half of it into a glass. i like it better since it's easier to drink. i got to say, for me its a 4.5 out of 5. (maybe less but i think i will be thrown out of any bar if i say that)"
"Heady Topper","This is a fantastic double IPA. I just wish it was easier to find ... just had another and think it was even more delicious that the last one!"
"Heady Topper","The best of the best. Puts all other beer to shame"
"Heady Topper","Great citrus and floral hops up front.  It has enough of a malt backbone to sustain it.  Definitely lives up to the hype."
"Heady Topper","My first 5;  I feel justified in the rating.  Everything is firing on all cylinders."
"Heady Topper","It backs all the hype, best DIPA I have ever had."
"Heady Topper","Lives up to all the hype. Wonderful aroma with notes of florals and citrus, and goes down incredibly smoothly. The extremely limited distribution and difficulty of acquisition of this beer certainly adds to the mystique/reputation. But the beer does stand on its own merits."
"Heady Topper","Best IPA beer in VT. Had it while I was on vacation there and it's really hard to get. Can't wait to visit the brewery in 2016."
"Heady Topper","Very smooth and well balanced but complex"
"Heady Topper","The greatest beer in the USA hands down"
"Heady Topper","Been fortunate to have access to this beer over the past few years....still amazes me...continues to be the best."
"Heady Topper","I actually liked this better from a glass than the can. Furthermore it apparently no longer has the disturbing pulpy appearance of years past, and looks pretty good. Just a cloudy orange color, nice foamy head and all that. Definitely lives up to its reputation but I have to say if you don't have access to this, New Glarus Scream is pretty darn similar in taste."
"Heady Topper","Thank you to my friend Matt for bringing this down to nyc. What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is one of the best beers I've ever had and clearly it's one of the best ever made. Mine was 6 days old. Sensational hoppy taste with some fruity notes, strong but drinks very easily. I poured a tiny smidge into a glass just to see the golden/amber beer-  but of course drank the rest from the can. Can't wait to drink another"
"Heady Topper","Lives up to the hype.  Great dipa.  Hazy golden.  2 fingers of head, lacing sticks forever.  Spicy fruit, loads of hops. It's a world class beer.  Glad to have tried it"
"Heady Topper","Enjoying the last Heady of my 4-pack tonight... from the can, obviously. This is easily one of my top 2 favorite beers. The hoppy, citrus flavor makes this beer incredibly easy-drinking. Its a game-changer. Can't wait to get my hands on some more."
"Heady Topper","I was lucky enough to trade for some of these fine IPAs with a friend and colleague on the east coast (Canada, no less). "
"Heady Topper","Tried this once and it was delicious. Would love to get my hands on more."
"Heady Topper","Gotta start with gratitude. Much love and big thanks to @Roguer for sending this one along in the BIF box I received. Awesome."
"Heady Topper","One of the top rated beers ever and I finally go my hands on some thanks to Drizzew5! I wanted to truly see this beer so I did pour it; sorry Alchemist."
"Heady Topper","for not being an IPA guy this definitely hit the top of my list of favorite IPAs.  it's lived up to the hype in my mind.  I haven't tried the infamous Maine Lunch.  But it's solid...."
"Heady Topper","I've been lucky enough to have a few of these. I'll need a few more."
"Heady Topper","Tried for the can and poured into a pint glass. Just OK, PtE beats it every day."
"Heady Topper","Though I don't follow the IPA craze, this beer, especially fresh, is the best balanced use of heavy hops I've ever encountered. It deserves it's high place"
"Heady Topper","Out of all the IPAs I have tasted, which is my favorite style of beer, this is a close second to Maine Beer Lunch. Just to add, honestly, drink it from the can! This beer starts, well sits on the palate well and finishes well; wish it was easier to find, it would be THEE go-to for me."
"Heady Topper","I wish my farts didn't smell so bad after drinking this gift from the gods"
"Heady Topper","I drank some from the can and poured the rest to see it. "
"Heady Topper","L - nice can, yellowish orange body, opaque, two finger head fades slowly"
"Heady Topper","I've never actually seen it, as I ""followed the rules"" on the few instances I've had the pleasure, so this is based on what I assume it must look like."
"Heady Topper","Been wanting to try this for a while, boy did it not disappoint.   Had a family friend bring home a case from Vermont.   By far the best DIPA I have ever had."
"Heady Topper","Best beer in all America! Perhaps in all the world!"
"Heady Topper","Pours a clear golden color with some head that disappears rather quickly."
"Heady Topper","Poured a little into a sample glass for smell and color, hazy light straw color. Smooth hop scent. "
"Heady Topper","Sad that I tried this, because I know I will never have again.  Is it the best beer in the world I did not think so but it was a GREAT beer and deserves to be thought of as one of the best."
"Heady Topper","Great beer, but recently moving from the west coast to the east coast, I felt it was too hyped up. 3-way from a group of oregon breweries, brother from Fremont, and top cutter from bale breaker from Washington state were just as good in their own ways. West coast IPA vs East/English coast IPA I guess. Still would drink it over most beers of offered."
"Heady Topper","Always ready for a Heady."
"Heady Topper","One of the best beers consumed by me in 2014."
"Heady Topper","Was skeptical of how good this could really be AND wow....Heady Topper lived up to the hype. Pretty much ruined every other beer I had the rest of the night."
"Heady Topper","Given the new rating system, I felt compelled to add a review to my score, even though this beer speaks for itself by now."
"Heady Topper","Believe the hype. This is the truth."
"Heady Topper","i drank it straight from the can as i was told to do.  this beer was really hoppy and delicious.  i have one more can and i'm going to drink it ASAP."
"Heady Topper","Can got provided by Steve, thank you very much!"
"Heady Topper","Without question the best beer I've ever tasted. Look, smell, taste all equate to perfection. Heady is Legend!"
"Heady Topper","L: a semi bright yellow/orange, some floating sediment, and a nice bright white head"
"Heady Topper","This is one of those beers that lives up to the hype. The smell is similar to other DIPA's but the taste is fantastic. The smooth citrusy hops stand out on their own and is something I will compare all other's in this category."
"Heady Topper","Smell smells like a medicinal weed shop. First sip was from the can. Really dank hoppy taste. Really hoppy and no malts. Rest of the beer was poured into a glass. The pour was perfect. I didn't even need to aggressively pour into the glass. From the glass, the beautiful smell goes away but the taste of the beer is still the same. Still tastes hoppy but I wish it was alittle more sweeter. It is like a less malty pure hoppiness from alpine beer company.  Only two problems, one is that the carbonation goes away fast, second is that the finish falls flat. I think pure hoppiness is a lot better than this"
"Heady Topper","Heady is a great beer, completely different from the west coast IPAs.  Hazy, yellow color, great hop aroma, nice malt balance.  Not my favorite Vermont IPA, though.  (Double Sunshine)."
"Heady Topper","16oz can purchased on 7/20 and  poured (yeah, yeah, yeah) into a Spiegelau glass.  Pours a beautiful hazy, orange color with about a finger of head dissipating to a nice ring. Smell is citrusy grapefruit and the taste does not disappoint.  Near perfect mouthfeel and finish. Definitely this hop lover's favorite DIPA."
"Heady Topper","From the reviews I read, I was a little disappointed. Maybe my tastebuds were dulled from an evening of enjoyment."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: pours a light honey color. a small half-finger to finger of a foamy white head with good retention and a solid lacing. completely hazy and opaque."
"Heady Topper","To me, this lives up to the hype.  Obviously some of the built-in hype is due to this beer's exclusivity to the VT region but I still think its fantastic.  Its one of the most refreshing DIPA's  I have ever tasted, I could easily sit back and have a couple of these on a hot summer afternoon.  Fantastic brew."
"Heady Topper","Too over hyped. I think people rate this beer to high"
"Heady Topper","Very good double IPA, not quite at the top echelon of the style but very close.  The appearance of the beer is extremely cloudy, bordering on chunky.  Aroma is amazing with dank, piney, and fruity hops all interplaying with the yeast esters.  The flavor is a little bit coarse and unrefined, but super hoppy and delicious.  Body is fairly dry, appropriate to the style.  Overall, this is like a hoppy punch to the face!"
"Heady Topper","Finally got a can, thanks Jim.  Took the first sip from the can, as directed, but had to pour into a pint glass to rate.  Poured a hazy medium straw color.  Overwhelmingly wonderful aroma.  The taste was nice at first, maybe felt a little thin on the palate, but each sip got better.  Small head with minimal retention, light lacing.  This beer is all about the aroma and flavor.  Piney earthy aromas and flavors.  Very much a New England example of an American DIPA, in the same ballpark of the Gandhi Bot. Goes down very easy for an 8% beer.  If I could get this beer regularly, I would have it prominently featured in the regular rotation."
"Heady Topper","Hoppy beer tasty Nice local Vermont beer"
"Heady Topper","I can say this beer has won hands down"
"Heady Topper","Still my favorite. Even with all the hype."
"Heady Topper","Fuzzy, juicy, incredibly aromatic, delicious stuff."
"Heady Topper","A complete, we'll rounded,  hopped up mofo...I wish I could use a better adjective than superlative and enjoyed as directed from the can."
"Heady Topper","Best beer I've ever had. Amazing. Must have. Very hard to find."
"Heady Topper","Not sure how fresh this can I got from a friend who got from a friend but Im extremely glad I finally got to try this beer. Stamp for manu date didnt make sense. "
"Heady Topper","My favorite beer of all time. Looking for a challenger"
"Heady Topper","Was a skeptic until I had one. I remember thinking ""why can't they all taste like this"" Unreal."
"Heady Topper","great beer! wish I could find it here in CT. gonna have to go to Vermont soon!"
"Heady Topper","Best IPA I've tried, by far. Sculpin by Ballast Point was comparable, but Heady Topper had the most fragrant nose and ever-changing taste I have had the chance to experience. Worth the two and a half hour drive (one-way), for sure. Drinking out of the can, as recommended, I only noted its light, creamy yellow color towards the end. Very smooth, and definitely not the most bitter IPA (as they admitted on the can), but I would have to agree with the brewer; ""sometimes I wish I could crawl into the can."""
"Heady Topper","It's like drinking from a pine tree."
"Heady Topper","A: Cool can art. Now that's a hophead. For the sake of this review I am disregarding the drink from can directions and inserting in glass."
"Heady Topper","Awesome.   It's up there as the best DIPA I have ever had."
"Heady Topper","Got to have it fresh."
"Heady Topper","Amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing"
"Heady Topper","Phenomenal beer, even my dog enjoys it!"
"Heady Topper","Smells like a edible bouquet of beer sunflowers that are grown by nude supermodels, potted in pots of water and wads of freshly printed cash , watered with Chuck Norris's sweat and bathed in moonbeams relfected off of a golden unicorn. "
"Heady Topper","Very good IPA, had along side a Pliny Elder and both stood up strong.  Color slightly hazy, smell not very strong, but great taste."
"Heady Topper","Drank one a year ago without knowing all the hype about it (hotel bar). Found it good the first time, better the second. Incredible taste."
"Heady Topper","Every mouthful was different...I am really going to need to try another just to analyze the different hop tastes. Probably the most complex beer I've ever had. It was a truly amazing experience."
"Heady Topper","I have been a big fan of IPA beers for over a year and have sampled at least 15 of the top IPAs.  I finally made it up to Stowe for skiing and got a chance to try the famous Heady Topper.  I could not  have have been more disappointed.  There is nothing extraordinary about this IPA whether you drink from the can or pour in a glass.   Stone Enjoy By is by far much better than HT.  If you have gotten hands on that one, not need to hunt down HT at least in my opinion."
"Heady Topper","I finally had the legendary IPA Heady Topper it meet all the expectations I had going into it."
"Heady Topper","Worth the hype? Oh yeah! This is probably the best smelling and best tasting beer in its class I have ever had. "
"Heady Topper","This is currently, my all-time favorite Imperial IPA. Thank goodness for a very generous brother-in-law who travels to Vermont! Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Delightful fresh IPA. I got a case and followed the instructions.... mostly... I poured one into a pint glass. Nice smooth head. It has a bright aroma and a smooth mouth feel. I will buy and drink another case when I get the chance. "
"Heady Topper","Tough call on this beer. I received two fresh cans overnight that were both kept cold the entire time. One can tasted awesome, but the second had a smoky almost burnt flavor to it. I've talked to a friend that had a similar experience. My rating would be much higher if both cans had tasted the same."
"Heady Topper","A: very cloudy pale. Nice white head but very minimal lacing"
"Heady Topper","This review is based on a couple of years of consuming heady on a fairly regular basis. When I first tried heady I was blown away at the freshness of the beer and the overall package the beer brought. There have been a couple of times that I had heady and it was not what it had been or what I was expecting, consistently good but never mind blowing as it once was."
"Heady Topper","Poured half the can into an ipa glass and savored the rest in the can.  Beautiful looking beer with a great pillow-cap fluffy head that seemed to last quite awhile.  The aroma of lemony tangerines and grapefruit is delightful.  Real easy to drink, the 8% not noticeable, and the smoothness is ridiculous!  Tastes like the aroma but probably even better!  Also I enjoyed the lack of a bitter aftertaste.  To summarize; Heady Topper was the most wonderful and amazing IPA I have had to opportunity to try.  The hype is well deserved and all my expectations were met!  Well done indeed."
"Heady Topper","Drink out of a can, do not pour :)  SO delicious!"
"Heady Topper","perfection in an IPA2. Not like anything else. Not bitter. Fruit forward but not fruity. Amazing."
"Heady Topper","Outstanding and lives up to the hype. Good luck finding it, they closed the brewery to tours due to traffic backing up the exit ramp."
"Heady Topper","Followed the instructions given…drank from the can and recycled."
"Heady Topper","One of the things that upset me the most about leaving Vermont and moving to Massachusetts... Now I have to drive 3 hours to search it out... But well worth the drive...."
"Heady Topper","Lived up to the hype!"
"Heady Topper","Ok being an IPA lover for many years Iv wanted to try this for ever! my amazing girlfriend just got 2 4packs for me for christmas,I got it 2 days early! :)"
"Heady Topper","The most perfectly balanced IPA I have ever had. Pours pretty thick with a strong head. Smells very earthy with nice hop aromas. Waves of flavors from sweet to citrus with a crisp dry finish and never wrecks your palette. I went out of may way to tried not to buy into the hype. But in the end it won me over, best beer I have ever tasted."
"Heady Topper","A brilliant, complex, and stunning DIPA on all accounts. Strong scent of pine, earth, floral aromas, and fragrant, fresh hops. The taste slams your palate against a hop wall that gives way to citrus, pine, peach, and genius hop flavor. These multiple flavors surf across the palate to settle into a lovely, magnificent finish. I'd compare the taste to a crashing hop wave that opens the palate with its startling, ingenious complexity. "
"Heady Topper","It's amazing beer advocate changed the rating system. Now, only ratings That come with a review of 150 characters will count. They've now just discounted thousands of ratings just because they want ""quality"". Well guess what, you now have a smaller sample size and beers with only 159 ratings are cracking the top 20. So stupid. It's 2015, people are busy. I don't want to spend 10 minutes describing my feelings about every beer I drink!"
"Heady Topper","Friend of mine turned me on to this beer and I absolutely love it, brought it to me young and it was a super refreshing flavorful beer."
"Heady Topper","This is hands down my favorite beer.  My buddy often works in Vermont and we are always requesting Heady Topper.  It can make a bad day awesome, an awesome day awesomer.  It is just a great thing to look forward to."
"Heady Topper","Received as an extra, (thanks Buford), and was excited as I was looking for this beer."
"Heady Topper","Tastes amazing an lives up to the hype. Sometimes hype can ruin something...it doesn't ruin this."
"Heady Topper","This is the best overall beer I have ever have. More than lives up to the hype.  3 weeks old.  Just unreal"
"Heady Topper","Poured it (I know) into a Parish mini snifter"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can as requested by The Alchemist. The anticipation of getting this beer lead to a little bit of an expectation that I didn't necessarily get from drinking this; however, I still think this is a stellar beer and will never turn it down!"
"Heady Topper","Poured into a Duvel tulip from a can.  (yes it says drink from can and I will with my next one and post it in this review also)"
"Heady Topper","What more can I say about Heady Topper that hasn't been said before?  Amazing tropical hoppy flavors that just explode from the can.  Amazing!"
"Heady Topper","After all the newfangled juice bombs coming out of VT/NE these days, I'll be darned if Heady still ain't king. You want to know why? Because it tastes and smells like a fucking IPA. It doesn't taste like a glass of orange juice. It doesn't smell like a Bath and Body Works display counter. I repeat: It tastes and smells like a fucking IPA. Sure, there are some really nice mango notes in the nose, a touch of dankness too. Sure, the palate has some tropical fruits, some clean, well-done malt, and an excellent level of bitterness to ground the brew. But this is a sum of all parts beer -- all the pieces work together to create, well, an IPA. Heavy is the Heady that wears the crown, but it's still the jewel of the NE."
"Heady Topper","Great beer.  Super hoppy, but a great drinker."
"Heady Topper","Brother bought me a case for my fiftieth birthday. He drove up  three hours one way to a store in Northern Vermont as the truck was arriving. They had sold out before he left with his share. "
"Heady Topper","I truly believe this is and always will be the best beer available.  If you love a perfect IPA, this is it.  It's a perfect balance of hops, bitterness, and malt.  There's a crisp-ness in the mouthfeel that I've never been able to find in any other IPA.  All I can do is hope John Kimmich at Alchemist produces more.  I work all year to trade and acquire Heady.  It's perfect."
"Heady Topper","Pours a sunshine yellow with a very subtle orange/yellow hue. Medium-heavy carbonation and a rich lathery head of foam."
"Heady Topper","Still remains my favorite beer out there since the time I've had it four years ago.  Absolutely no way to be mad at this beer.  If you don't like IPA's, I urge someone to take a step outside their box and have a HT.  Drink this beer out of the can, very few places will tap this beer.  ""Don't be a DB.""  Try it."
"Heady Topper","Absolutely delicious. Tastes great with anything. Seriously. I now take the 2 hour drive twice a year to stock up."
"Heady Topper","I get all the hype. It is a delicious beer. Part of the mystique is due to limited distribution though. I get it a few times per season. Best for a crisp winter day during a pond hockey set break."
"Heady Topper","Happy to try this for a second time - many thanks to a generous colleague. "
"Heady Topper","I hate to be cliche, but this is definitely my new favorite IPA. The flavor was incredible, and the aftertaste is just perfect. This is the perfect beer for me."
"Heady Topper","An absolute favorite."
"Heady Topper","Best.  Beer.  Ever.  This beer, right in the first sip, is like fireworks in your mouth.  And each subsequent sip is simply better than the last."
"Heady Topper","More hype than taste for me."
"Heady Topper","Just joined BA so I rating all the beers I love."
"Heady Topper","Just a world class IPA. great flavors that really bring out the different hops used. I;d get a 2nd."
"Heady Topper","its a perfect beer.  really is has everything you want from an iipa.  drove 8hrs round trip to get a case and ready to do it again asap!"
"Heady Topper","Enough hop and alcohol which makes it my best double ipa."
"Heady Topper","Excellent. Both nose and taste hits you like no other"
"Heady Topper","5/5 "
"Heady Topper","This is a work of art. Big thanks to metsfan1 for the trade. this is now the standard bearer for me for any ipa from the east coast. Or damn near anywhere for that matter. Believe the hype."
"Heady Topper","November 29, 2014"
"Heady Topper","From the can in Burlington Vt. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, mango, peach. Flavors come through like the nose. Pretty epic. Taste follows the nose to a T. It's an explosion of hops, starting sweet and fruity and slowly building bitterness the more you drink it. Worth the hype? I think so. Is it the best beer in the world I ever had? I don't know, but its right up there and damn close. Glad I got my hands on it."
"Heady Topper","My only gripe is the whole drink from a can...I'm not buying that. However, this is by far and above my favorite beer to date. The perfect balance of hops and malt for my palate. Although hop forward, there isn't that strange aftertaste associated with some overtly hoppy beers. The alcohol seems non-existent. Notes and tastes of citrus (grapefruit in particular) meet a creamy and well-rounded pine."
"Heady Topper","Just like everyone else says... It's awesome... Best straight from the can like it says... Best fresh as well, even though it's still delicious after a couple of weeks.. Definitely a beer you must try at least once.."
"Heady Topper","Dank tasty brewski"
"Heady Topper","Better from the tap than the can, but still the kitty's titties all around."
"Heady Topper","Dank and piney, with a little citrus in the background. Well balanced and very drinkable. Drunk half in the can and half in the glass.  I prefer the glass. Delicious."
"Heady Topper","This was honestly fantastic beer (better than I anticipated, I thought it would be over rated). Best in the world?... to hard to quantify but this beer pushes perfection. I will say, I had two cans shipped to me, had the first out of a can and the second out of a glass (because I like to look my beer in the eyes while I sip it) it was better out of the can, though I also had it 3 weeks fresher from the can. Somehow this beer manages to have a serious hop punch that still feels balanced."
"Heady Topper","Very citrusy on the nose. Pours a cloudy light orange. Very very light with a nice citrus hop bite. Really refreshing for a DIPA"
"Heady Topper","Heady topper pours a hazy golden orange (I prefer it from the glass, despite what is written on the can). Smell and taste are citrus and some bitterness, less tropical fruit than other New England style ipas. Mouth fee is spot on. Overall, deserving of its high ratings."
"Heady Topper","Amazing! Had it in Boston from a local mom and pop beer store! Amazing Aroma full flavor! Will buy/trade for again!"
"Heady Topper","This is a tremendous double IPA, but I don't put it on the same level with some other Vermont hoppy offerings, such Focal Banger, Sip of Sunshine, and Abner. Heady is a touch too malty and sweet for me, but still a wonderful brew."
"Heady Topper","Phenomenal hoppy finish"
"Heady Topper","Smooth one of the best IPA I've had."
"Heady Topper","Are you kidding? This is the nectar of the beer Gods. The hype is real, my expectations have been met and exceeded. If you want a breakdown of the subtle nuances, look at all the other reviews. This was 6 or 7 day old beer, and if you are lucky like me and get 4 of them, by all means drink it from the can as recommend, when poured into a glass the flavor seemed diminished. Enjoyed!!"
"Heady Topper","Would I stand for several hours in line hoping to grab a case of the highly sought after The Alchemist#HeadyTopper... No! However, this imperial IPA may be one of the best IPAs I have tried from the Northeast. The  aroma reminds me of fresh squeezed orange juice & the  palate is an assassination of hops! Grapefruit, orange, mango, lemongrass & fresh resinous marijuana. This IPA's personality is vibrant, flavorful, assertive and bone dry. But somehow, the danky aroma & the aggressive bitterness find a way to coexist as one. If a friend or someone offers one up.. Take it because it worth trying and experiencing. #craftbeer"
"Heady Topper","Poured a little of this out into a snifter just to see color and get some smells. The rest will be drank from the can as demanded."
"Heady Topper","The ultimate IPA"
"Heady Topper","Its the complete package.  Had my first can last night at One Mile House which they were serving for their anniversary.  Actually ordered a Maine Lunch first upon seeing it on their extensive beer list. They have it on tap. After taking my first sip I noticed the guy next to me drinking a Heady Topper out of the unmistakable can. I was shocked and immediately order one - now double fisting a heady topper and a main lunch.  The rest is between me and my taste buds, but all of the accolades here are spot on."
"Heady Topper","The best beer by far ever brewed."
"Heady Topper","Type: 16-oz. can"
"Heady Topper","Was lucky enough to take a trip up to Stowe and Burlington last weekend.  As a non-hophead this is incredibly drinkable.  The bitterness does not destroy your tastebuds like most DIPAs and the taste is fantastic.  I came across it in a liquor store later in the day and bought the limit for an individual."
"Heady Topper","Well this beer was everything i hoped for and more. Definitely lives up to all of the hype. Perfect balance of fruit and bitterness from the hops and the malt profile balances them out perfectly. don't know if there will ever be a more balanced beer then this. its everything i wish for in an IPA"
"Heady Topper","When Fresh (within 10 days) best IPA ever!"
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy honey orange with 2 finger white head.  Smells floral, orange/grapefruit.  Tastes of sweet orange blossom,grapefruit, sweet malt and pine.  Silky medium/full body with medium carbonation.  Leaves a great hop resin in mouth and lips and back of throat.  Incredible beer."
"Heady Topper","Not sure how my prior rating was at 4.75.  This beer was easily one of the best I have had to date."
"Heady Topper","The last of days  arrived."
"Heady Topper","Love this beer. Great citrus hop one of the best beers ever"
"Heady Topper","Worth the wait, meets the hype"
"Heady Topper","Never did I think something so amazing could come from a can. I love this beer."
"Heady Topper","This smells fantastic, very hoppy and aromatic, but I find it a bit too bitter for my tastes."
"Heady Topper","Had in glass and from can.  Better from can (that is a minus)."
"Heady Topper","A true double IPA. Hard to get unless you wait in line for around an hour or better during the week. Smooth from start to finish and be sure to listen to the can and drink from it"
"Heady Topper","Got this on trade. I know it says drink from the can, but I poured it slowly into a glass. Looks like grapefruit juice. Big resin, grapefruit, and tropical fruit aroma. Very tasty. Lots of grapefruit taste. Good bitter punch. So juicy. Hints of orange and other citrus taste. Totally amazing beer."
"Heady Topper","Perfect example of an ipa. So much aroma and citrus flavors especially grapefruit up front. No lingering bitterness. So drinkable i drank 10 in one night. One of the few beers that lives up to the hype"
"Heady Topper","Quite simply, the gold standard of IPA.  Intensely hoppy, yet effortlessly drinkable.  Pure balance.  The more double IPA's I try, the more I appreciate Heady."
"Heady Topper","Surprisingly clean finish without sacrificing flavor.  Pleasant IPA.  Hoppy & creamy."
"Heady Topper","Hard to live up to the hype but this beer came through in a big way. Couldnt ask for a better beer"
"Heady Topper","Quit reading reviews and just find this beer the best you can. It is hop heaven in a can!"
"Heady Topper","Slightly overrated but not by much! I'm more of a citra/citrus light bodied ipa guy though. Still a FANTASTIC beer!"
"Heady Topper","Just bad ass.....was able try a few this year (friends that built a home up in VT) It was all that was promised. Won't disappoint.... Unless you're not an IPA guy.....but don't even waste it on those folks ;)"
"Heady Topper","Don't see the big deal here.  Very similar to many other citrusy DIPA's with a little creaminess to it."
"Heady Topper","Amazing hop nose and surprisingly smooth drinking.  Grapefruit throughout with a dry finish. The abv hides behind how tasty it is and then it punches you in the face after your second."
"Heady Topper","Good but highly overrated beer."
"Heady Topper","Poured with Jake_ramrod on Halloween. Thanks for the scary share."
"Heady Topper","the beer by which i judge all beer"
"Heady Topper","Acquired in trade.  Extremely easy drinking brew that packs quite the punch of flavor at the front of the tongue. Booze is well hidden. It is crazy how easy drinking this beer is.  World class, but falls a close 2nd to Pliny."
"Heady Topper","The best IPA, EVER. Worth the 2 1/2 hour wait. I recommend all Hop heads to try this if they can get their hands on some. This brewery knows what supply & demand is all about. Two thumbs up!"
"Heady Topper","Glowing hazy yellow with a thick head. "
"Heady Topper","Not much more to say than what's been said.  Stands tall in the world of DIPA's and is amazing on tap and excellent in the can.  Not my favorite DIPA but in the top 10."
"Heady Topper","I finally got the chance to experience the best. The beer was really good but not my favorite. I finally have accepted that cans are good for beer but I still enjoy them in an appropriate glass. I did as told and enjoyed this one straight from the can. Other getting to show off my prize, I did not care for the can experience. "
"Heady Topper","After all the trouble of getting it, I fully intended to pace my way through the case. Somehow though, I can't usually bring myself to drink something else when there's a cold Heady in the fridge."
"Heady Topper","Out of the can as instructed.  Great, consistent hoppy flavor.  Terrific enhancer of sharp cheddar resting on tongue.  Makes cheese pop and the finish of this ADIPA holds up.  Very drinkable."
"Heady Topper","Absolutely everything you'd expect"
"Heady Topper","For me this is my favorite DIPA, It was my first experience with a DIPA and the one I compare others to."
"Heady Topper","The best beer I ever had.  Simply wonderful."
"Heady Topper","Let me start this review by saying: it's been a long time coming and much anticipated to finally get my hands on this gem!!!!  "
"Heady Topper","one of the best beers in a can, hands down."
"Heady Topper","I need more!"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can purchased at Craft Beer Cellar in Waterbury.  Drank the first can in my hotel room and poured the second into a snifter just to see the color."
"Heady Topper","Pours a glowing orange somewhat hazy tint. One of the brightest beers I've ever seen in the glass. Smell is unlimited sweet citrusy hops. So incredibly sweet on the nose. Like hoppy candy. The taste is awesome. Great bursts of citrusy west coast hops but also a good bit of pine. Surprisingly balanced in terms of hop profile. Mouthfeel is pretty standard of a DIPA. Smooth and well carbonated. Overall this is such a great beer. Maybe not the greatest beer of all time but defimtiely something I wish I could keep in my fridge at all times."
"Heady Topper","Huge beer with an enticing nose and massive, complex flavor. Ignoring the print around the top of the can, ""Drink From the Can,"" I poured this into my usual tasting glass and enjoyed the soft aromas of bitter orange, sweet malt and citrus, with spicy and earthy notes. The flavor was intriguing and seemed perfectly balanced."
"Heady Topper","Simply the standard for a DIPA."
"Heady Topper","Everybody wants to make the next heady topper. Or the heady killer. And nobody can because the alchemist made the prototype east coast IPA before anyone else could beat them to it. Massive juicy citrus hops all up in your face. Hazy and beautifully bright golden in appearance. Mouthfeel is superb, very soft but still really well carbonated. Lacks the bitter dank finish of west coast styles but that's why people love it. Get your hands on a heady and your taste buds will be rewarded."
"Heady Topper","Had Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder side by side... Both are equally awesome"
"Heady Topper","Pint can poured into a pint glass (because I wanted to look at it). No date that I can see -- but purchased a week ago today, and flown home in a friend's luggage. Another gift from him that elicited a nerdy gasp of delight when I found it on my desk."
"Heady Topper","After driving all day through winding Vermont by-roads with my wife (she wasn't a problem, but endless construction was) and waiting in a long-ass line at Beverage Baron, you bet I was going to pour this into a glass.  I could smell tangy hops as soon as I cracked the can, which was a good sign."
"Heady Topper","Had this a few years back and did a 5 rating, back when you could just scroll an select a single rating.  Got a 4-pack via trade.  Gotta say, the 5 stands.  This beer is soooo good.  Immediately after finishing the last one, I was scheming on how I could get some more.  The beer is very hazy in color, golden almost.  Smells like a helicopter crashed in a gigantic field of hops and the blades spun around for 10 minutes.  Taste is so unique:  You do, as the can says, get wave after wave of hop flavor washing over your palate.  Man, it is so delish.  Feel is also fantastic.  I can't wait to get me some more of this."
"Heady Topper","I really am not a fan of this new ""ratings"" system. However if the only way for my rating to count is to review, so be it. This is what the gold standard should be for a DIPA.  Magnificent in every way."
"Heady Topper","Skunky before you even taste it olfactory is in overdrive."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can... 1/2 drank from can (as directed), 1/2 from tulip"
"Heady Topper","Well.... i live here in the great state of vermont. And i can get heady topper pretty much whene ever i want (im a chef, always have the stuff). This is a good IPA. I like it for its culture shock and I respect its cult folowing, however i actually do not like the beer. Its unbalanced, and dry hopped way to long for my taste. As a chef im always looking for balence and this just does not have it. But i do understand why hop heads around the country flock for it."
"Heady Topper","Awesome do have 12 fresh ones for trade"
"Heady Topper","Smuggled some Cans down to my surf lodge in Nicaragua. YEAH BUDDY!"
"Heady Topper","Amazing brew. I've had around 12, and only drank one out of the can. Shun me!"
"Heady Topper","So glad to have gotten ahold of some of this beer. It's the perfect DIPA"
"Heady Topper","What can be said that has not already been said... just get your hands on one"
"Heady Topper","On a trip up north to Vermont I realized I was in Heady topper country.  I honestly wanted not to like this beer based on the fact everybody likes it.  I thought the limited access was the majority of the reason it was so desirable.   Expecting a normal IPA with some deviations I can say I was dead wrong.   It was like nothing else I've had before but so familiar to my favorite hoppy IPA style.   I was a little unsettled about drinking it out if the can but got used to it after the third one.    The first thing I did was smell the hoppy aroma which was great. The beer was excellent, a dank, hoppy, piney, citrusy IPA with a more heavy mouthfeel.  Very complex   If I could buy this I would always have a 4 pack in my fridge.  But I'm from NY and the beer doesn't travel far. I tried 5 or 6 different stores the alchemist website states it delivers to and all the stores sell out in hours to a single day.   A bartender hooked me up with two cans after a couple of hours of drinking and chatting.   It's not easy to obtain this brew making me want it more.   The two in my fridge are killing me right now     I'll be sure to give one to a real beer guy friend who knows his hops and has been around the beer isles.  This will not be wasted on a bud light drinker I promise"
"Heady Topper","Tap and 16 oz can. Very good IPA, especially when had fresh from the tap at the brewery. Delightful citrus/hop flavor that isn't overpowering. Get this if you can."
"Heady Topper","16oz Can."
"Heady Topper","Well I finally had a chance to try the infamous Heady Topper. A friend was working in Vermont and came across a 4 pak at, of all places, a gas station convenience store. Well, with great anticipation, we sat down at my home bar, popped the top on a can and away we went. First thing to hit you was the aroma. Piney, hoppy. And that's where it ended for me. This beer is better suited to be an air freshener than a drink. I was sitting there tasting what in my opinion is way over the top flavor finished with bitterness. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. With all of the thousands of beers in the world this is the # 1? Not a chance. In the end I felt like a kid who got a beautifully wrapped gift only to discover a bag of sox or underwear inside. What a bummer."
"Heady Topper","This beer is so unique and exceptional that it's hard for me to figure out how it was concocted."
"Heady Topper","Deserves it's number one rating.  This is one of the great beers of all times.  It redefines the IPA category.  Very juicy and aromatic.  The alcohol is well hidden."
"Heady Topper","It really is unique and fabulous. I've had a ton, and it does vary in quality from time to time, but has never been anything lower than ""great"". Seriously, the worst I've had is still very delicious. I've had hundreds of cans, had many a sampler from the brewery when it was open and also had on draft several times. All good stuff."
"Heady Topper","Yeah.  I could drink this all day.  And night.  And day again..."
"Heady Topper","A quick review as I didn't take tasting notes and had a few days ago.  Drank from a 16 ounce can poured into a pint beer glass and drank with friends after a 10K race."
"Heady Topper","I was fortunate to try this beer twice thanks to a good friend. Once when it was ranked #3 back in 2011 or 2012 when I was still a novice beer drinker and had no idea what  dIPA beer was or how it was suppose to taste. Now after trying  over 200+ beers I would say my taste for beer has developed alot more esp. enjoying Sours, IPAS, and any stouts barrel  aged I cam to appreciate this beer much more. Loved the aromas and taste of all the hops and flavors delivered from "
"Heady Topper","When the can says to not use a glass you gotta wonder. Having tried it both ways, the can is right. This is a perfectly balanced DIPA. Layers and waves of hops. Strong malty backbone. Spot on carbonation and weight. A huge thanks to my great beer buddy Chris Brady for the four pack of this exceptional beer. I could drink this all day. No trace of the abv, sneaky drinkability. WOW."
"Heady Topper","Appearance:  I drank most from the can, as directed, but did cheat and poured into a glass."
"Heady Topper","Heady is delicious - no doubt about it. I wouldn't say it lives up to the hype like Double Sunshine or Abner, but it's definitely not a disappointment either. I'm drinking my 8th can as I type this FYI."
"Heady Topper","I can see why they only made this for a while.  One of the best beers for sure.  I had it on draft a couple times in VT and it lives up to the pretty much lives up to the hype.  Hazy and orange in the glass.  Odor of citrus, pine and tropical fruit.  Taste follows odor with a great balance of hops throughout.  Never over powering, well balanced. Ends nice and dry.  Overall, an excellent ipa and an outstanding beer."
"Heady Topper","Perfect combination of bread sweetness, Citrusy hops and sweet alcohol.  The greatest dip around"
"Heady Topper","Worth the hype and the flavor and aroma makes this one of the best DIPA's ever made."
"Heady Topper","BEST BEER I've ever had"
"Heady Topper","Perfection in a can."
"Heady Topper","At the time of this review, Heady topper is ranked on Beer Advocate as the best beer in the world.  I was up at Stowe in Vermont for a british car show and found a bar that served this infamous beer on tap. Overall, if I didn't know this beer was so highly ranked, I would have thought Its alright, but not memorable in the least. If anything, all the flavors are very well balanced. The only decreeable flavor i could pick out was mandarin orange. I think this would be a nice session beer, but this is absolutely not a memorable beer. For all the hype, this was a letdown as there's nothing memorable, special or unique about it. FWIW, I'm also not really an IPA guy."
"Heady Topper","One does not simply quaff Heady Topper. It needs to be enjoyed with complete awareness and yet total relaxation, in the fullness of time, each sip a journey to an exotic Roger Dean-esque alien landscape, where you sit beneath a strangely geometric tree, listening to the far-off flesh-eating birds chirping, and think, ""This couldn't get any weirder. Well, maybe if I were tripping, too."""
"Heady Topper","What is most striking to me about Heady Topper is the smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  The hop aroma and flavor are fresh, bright and juicy.  The bitterness is about perfect.  But to me it's that mouthfeel that is most distinctive.  Well, that and the large amount of beautiful yeast sediment that you can culture from any can."
"Heady Topper","Solid. Not cool I have to drive 3 hours to get!"
"Heady Topper","This beer changed my life."
"Heady Topper","One of my favorite Double IPA's!"
"Heady Topper","One of the best DIPA's I've ever had the privilege of drinking.  For a DIPA to have so many aromas and tastes mingle so well with no one of them overpowering the others is a testament to the brewers.  Tough to get but worth the effort."
"Heady Topper","A review is meaningless, there's nothing to complain about unless you haven't had it before, in which case you are most definitely doing something wrong. So dank, so heady. "
"Heady Topper","First sampled Sept 2014 at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT as part of an epic flight* (Heady, Edward, Sip of Sunshine, and Conehead); revisited today (April 3 2015) courtesy of a trade with one of our local ski club members who had the presence of mind to buy a CASE while he was up that way."
"Heady Topper","A good but overrated DIPA.  Good hops profile and a solid malt backbone but nothing about it was overly impressive.  As has been said in many other BA reviews before, I've had better IPAs and DIPAs.  Maybe the cans I have aren't the freshest?  Honestly, if it had a wide distribution I believe this beer would drop out of the top 10 on the BA 250.  Does anybody remember Westy 12 being #1 a couple years ago?  After their 12/12/12 release in the US that beer has steadily moved down to #12.  I certainly won't seek out Heady again unless it's straight from the brewery."
"Heady Topper","best dipa there is going"
"Heady Topper","This is a perfect IPA. World Class!"
"Heady Topper","If the color and head are not impressive enough, the taste is dazzling.  Grapefruity, hoppy, raw, full, malty, bitter, smooth are some of the many descriptions that come to kind.  A great and complex drink.  I am usually jot an IPA fan, but thia beer is in a class of its own."
"Heady Topper","I still prefer Pliny, but this IPA still blows me away. It is better straight from the can, but I usually like getting the aroma from a beer while drinking it."
"Heady Topper","World class.  Finding one can be a bit tricky though.  My friend got me one at a phish concert but I  was left with a feeling of disappointment.  I think they had allowed it to get warm which affected the taste. I then took a trip to Vermont and headed straight for Waterbury.  I thought it would be easy to find once I got to the home town but I may as well have been in California. I struck gold at the best Western hotel I stayed at because their cafe had some in stock.  I did end up finding some to bring home after following multiple leeds taking me to multiple towns."
"Heady Topper","Had half from the can, half poured in a glass, just couldn't resist."
"Heady Topper","Had this twice! Soo soo good! I wish it wasn't so hard to get a hold of in California. Where all my beer geeks at?? I need this in California!"
"Heady Topper","Purchased on 8/21 and 8/22.  Some of the cans tasted amazing and others not that remarkable.  In the cans that were less than remarkable, I observed what I think is an usual amount of air space between the top of the can and the top of the beer inside the can.  In terms of volume, it was approximately a 1 ounce void in a 16 ounce can. In these cans the bottom of the tab, once opened, barely touched the top of the beer.  I found myself wondering if this air space contributed to off flavors, mainly because the cans I thought tasted amazing were full of beer - no air void in the can. It's a solid beer and it's fun to stand in line for it, but each time I head to VT I find myself more impressed with other VT offerings and less impressed with Heady."
"Heady Topper","Very nice, dank and piney aroma and taste. Very balanced between malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Only downside for me is the lack of some tropical fruit and the alcohol being just a bit too present."
"Heady Topper","I'll preface this by saying I was incredibly skeptical of this beer. I was in Vermont and couldn't pass it up. Everyone kept telling me it was the greatest thing ever, all I could think was ""yeah right don't buy the hype."" Now I know that no amount of hype can do justice to this beer."
"Heady Topper","I tried a few ounces in a tulip, and the rest out of the can. I have to say I enjoyed the tulip better as I consumed it as the bouquet was opening. In the end, it was simply a delicious beer."
"Heady Topper","Consumed in both the Can and out of a glass.  Can is a bit better."
"Heady Topper","Very good."
"Heady Topper","Best double IPA"
"Heady Topper","Everytime, I drink this beer. It's like my first time. "
"Heady Topper","poured a orange/yellowish color with a bubbly white head. smells like like grapefruit and earthy pine.  taste was almost so grapefruity it was tart and sour.  amazingly smooth and each sip grew with more hops.  Texture was kind of thick.  Def overrated in my eyes for a double ipa but I would say this is top 15 dipas in my book"
"Heady Topper","I dont understand why I am not giving this a 5.  Its one of my all time favorite beers."
"Heady Topper","Love the hoppy goodness"
"Heady Topper","WOW Fantastic."
"Heady Topper","Case purchased 8/8/14 at Hunger Mountain Co-Op. Gave away half, drank half. Not much variation between cans, which is what they strive for."
"Heady Topper","Got to try a sample of this beer. Pretty damn good IPA. It reminds me of a really good, unfiltered homebrewed IPA that is bombed with hops."
"Heady Topper","By far, the nicest look and feel of a bottled/canned IIPA. Big fluffy white head and oodles of glass sticking lace. Low-medium carbonation give it a very soft and creamy feel, particularly when pared with the medium+ body. Aroma and flavor are as good as you could want for the style. Lots of pine and a long lasting bitter finish. Residual sugars lean it a click toward the sweet side and there's a touch of alcohol in the finish. Big thanks to Chuk for securing this one for me."
"Heady Topper","Straw colored DIPA, with great head. The beer is incredible, so aromatic and floral. The hop profile is incredible but the beer is also very well balanced."
"Heady Topper","I thank my best friend for introducing me to craft beer and...heady topper. I now hate my best friend as I am now addicted and have to drive to Vermont and wait in line to buy heady topper!!"
"Heady Topper","Heady is so aromatic. Lots of citrus including Juicy grapefruit, tangerine and dank hops. Very slight hints of hay as it warms."
"Heady Topper","First and foremost, gotta give a BIG thanks to DCLAguy11 for hooking me up with this brew I've been wanting to quaff for over a year. Seriously, thank you. I was really excited to try this. Re-he-he-heally excited."
"Heady Topper","Overall: Fukin' Heady... ""That's all I have to say about that"", for now, haha... So good"
"Heady Topper","Just had my first of the mythical heady topper this evening!"
"Heady Topper","Finally got to have one of these last night!  To me, this beer is perfect."
"Heady Topper","Look, I'm not going to add a whole lot to the conversation here, but I've got to write something - I'm tearing up as I type... I've had this 4 times now. 1st at a party in Somerville, and I was half in the bag already. 2nd time it was warm. 3rd time was a tip from a guy at the bar I work at 2 a.m. And I'm having one now. All have been memorable. It is a remarkable experience."
"Heady Topper","I've had a few of these and hands down it's the best beer out there with outstanding flavors!"
"Heady Topper","This is a beautiful IPA that holds back on the bitterness that can *sometimes* overpower the delicate flavors in hops. While I love bitter beers that push the IBUs like Stone's 'Ruination,' Heady Topper takes the opposite approach while still maintaining a well-balanced malt character. The waves of hops wash over your palate and after you swallow you're left with that biscuity aftertaste from the lighter malts. "
"Heady Topper","Had never heard of this before but my local place got it on tap and wow it was excellent with a bit heavy on the froth but still a great pour. Not in your face like many imperials but smooth with a ton of hops and flavor. Didn't realize it was 8% until it started to hit me as I finished it as I hadn't eaten yet."
"Heady Topper","The best IPA I've ever had. Huge difference between drinking it from the can vs. pouring it. Do what the can says and drink it from the can."
"Heady Topper","First beer I had in my trip to Vermont. From very recent notes."
"Heady Topper","As instructed, drank from the can. "
"Heady Topper","Smooth IPA for 8%"
"Heady Topper","To be fair, my buddy and I drove up to VT to get our hands on this beer that is in high demand and only sold in VT."
"Heady Topper","A: Golden, Hazy, Very Cloudy, Two-Finger White Head, Medium/High Carbonation, Decent Lacing."
"Heady Topper","It meets the hype"
"Heady Topper","exceptional IPA"
"Heady Topper","For my tastes, this beer is the perfect IPA. "
"Heady Topper","Long time awaiting this masterpiece  -- was the fortunate recipient of this tremendous beer from a fellow patriot and beer guy from Vermont that hand carried it back to Germany from the Northeast Craft Beer Mecca!  Poured into and enjoyed from a Spiegelau IPA glass – sorry, John, I just can’t drink this White Whale from the can.  "
"Heady Topper","worth the hype.  hard to see it being toppered,  but so hard to obtain"
"Heady Topper","What now, Pliny?  ALL HAIL NORTHERN VT!!!"
"Heady Topper","Really enjoyed this but I do think it is slightly overrated. The initial burst of hop flavor is something I will always remember.  But the thrill only seemed to last halfway through the can, or my palate just got used to it.  Its an aggressive beer for sure and really well crafted."
"Heady Topper","Broke the can's rules to properly review. Pale cloudy orange juice. 1 finger soft head but a light film sticks. Good lacing. I don't know what's in here but smells fantastic. Beautiful bouquet of hops. Great balance of citrus and bitterness. Strong carbonation but smooth and yet great mouthfeel. Like a 5 gum commercial. Can't go wrong with this beer."
"Heady Topper","Reviewed from notes. Sixteen ounce can shared by Dan - thanks."
"Heady Topper","The Benchmark!"
"Heady Topper","As good as it gets. Tastes like you are drinking a double IPA flavored creamsicle. Super smooth feel, citrusy aroma. Love drinking it out of the can but will occasionally pour it into a glass to see that beautiful orangey, hazy color."
"Heady Topper","Consumed directly out of the can as directed on the labeling. No canned on or best by date present. Purchased at Bueno Y Sano (Burlington, VT). "
"Heady Topper","Amazing beer just not the best Beer or IPA out there.  "
"Heady Topper","I love this beer."
"Heady Topper","With such a quick turn around the beer is always fresh and delicious."
"Heady Topper","Can never go wrong"
"Heady Topper","I have been waiting a year to grab this beer.  Even though I hate IPAs, I wanted to see if this beer is worth the hype.  I wasn't disappointed, an IPA I actually didn't mind drinking, which is the ultimate sign of respect from anti-IPA drinker.  I can see why you ""hop heads"" dream over it"
"Heady Topper","Brilliantly subtle. Hop flavor is strong, but not overpowering at all. The finish is somehow simultaneously light yet dense.  Very balanced and amazingly drinkable. A remarkable beverage."
"Heady Topper","Great Hop Profile / Subtle Aroma / three sips in and you realize why it's #1 / Can drink this for days!"
"Heady Topper","Delicious. I love the smell of smarties."
"Heady Topper","Amazing Aroma. Had from Can as well as Glass. And man o Man, THis shit is bANging. Very nice lush mouthfeel, smooth drinking, and just overall balanced and well madE."
"Heady Topper","When you get the right batch, there is no beer better than Heady Topper. "
"Heady Topper","Damn, finally my excessive beer drinking has paid off and I have been granted the opportunity to at last taste the topper. Served in a can as the label so duly instructs, I did pour a smidge into a snifter for the sole purpose of being able to rate the appearance. And so here it goes..."
"Heady Topper","Just was not as special as when I first tasted Pliny the Elder"
"Heady Topper","This beer is a stable and outstanding brew.  There is nothing to negatively state about it.  The only reason I give it a 4.5 is because there is something that I taste in Pliny, Fat heads Hop JuJu and Three Floyds Permanent Funeral that just amazes me.  I believe its the fruity aroma matched with the spectrum of flavors that hit me from those beers over Heady.  Can't go wrong with heady though, its outstanding."
"Heady Topper",Delicious
"Heady Topper","Purchased 2 cases in barre,vt on 08/11/14 "
"Heady Topper","What better way to break in my brand new snifter than with a can of Heady Topper, the #1 rated beer on Beer Advocate."
"Heady Topper","I had this the first time I thought it wasn't impressive.  I had it the next time side by side with pliny and I was blown away.Great beer with such a smooth taste and finish. Tons of fruit on the tongue and the finish was silky smooth.For a DIPA this is very drinkable. Can't wait to get some more."
"Heady Topper","The hype is real. Tried my first heady last weekend. There is not much I can say that has not already been said. So, I will say that you have not tried an IPA until you drink one of these bad boys. I was in heaven from the start with the amazing floral smell. The taste is perfect it's crazy. I thought all the hype would ruin it. But no way...Like I said in the beginning the hype is real."
"Heady Topper","I don't get it. Maybe I'm daft but the reasons for the over-the-top love for this beer elude me. It's a very nice, refreshing, not terribly complex brew. Good quaffer on a hot summer day, with a light grapefruity bitterness and a clean finish. It's fine. It's nice. I'll drink it again for $4 a can, but I won't drive to Vermont to get it or pay a scalper $14 for it. If I don't see it again, no big deal, there are hundreds of equally good, similar brews out there. "
"Heady Topper","Pours a cloudy, unfiltered burnt orange color with a white soapy head. Pillowy foam.The aroma, well it is quite hoppy with floral, pine and citrus notes. Hints of honey and citrus oil."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is not overrated. My first taste tonight (technically 4th) of this fine, superfine IPA , and I was not disappointed. West Coast style, in my opinion, and a beautiful cloudy hoppy dirty brew. If you pour it in a glass. Which is NOT recommended, so says the can. Well, some like it in the can, and I tried it, then poured it into a pint glass. "
"Heady Topper","Poured into Dogfish IPA glass"
"Heady Topper","One of the greatest of all times. Well worth the trip to Vermont to get it."
"Heady Topper","Poured out a bit but kept most in the can. Definitely not as ugly as I was expecting. It's just a bit hazy. Golden body and good looking white head. "
"Heady Topper","Best DIPA in the world. Feel like the ABV % is much higher than stated, which is a bonus. "
"Heady Topper","I am looking at all of these reviews from people all around the country,getting this beer shiped or allowed warm at any time, the taste seems to get compromised and you dont get to enjoy the full experience. If your in Vermont, waiting every Wednesday at 10 am outside of the store for the truck to arrive, hoping you'll get a 4 pack or 2, when it's as fresh as ever. "
"Heady Topper","I thought maybe the hype was too much for this beer, but god damn! This is amazing! The appearance is a dark golden hue with a nice head that lasts and then trails down the glass. The smell is full of citrus and baked bread. The taste is crazy complex with different sensations of hops coming through all through out the taste. Love this one, maybe a new favorite."
"Heady Topper","I was lucky enough to try my first Heady thanks to a very generous fellow BA(mojosly!!)"
"Heady Topper","I was able to get a can of the Heady Topper through a new acquaintance out of J'Town, PA. I traded Two Bros Night Cat and Side Kick for it. The beer poured a hazy straw color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is mostly sweet malt....and I was hoping for more pine and citrus. The taste was a good balance between sweeter malt and bitter hops there is presence of some pine and a touch of apricot like citrus all bolstered by an oily resiny base. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer....but not the best IPA I've had (IMO). It's great...don't get me wrong...but the original Zombie Dust before is was massed produced was better."
"Heady Topper","Hard-to-find, but when I did I drink it straight from the can. Overall a good IPA but not the best I've ever had. I busted two cans in my luggage flying back from Vermont. So please protect it better than I did. Hoppy yes, but not too hoppy. Good balance."
"Heady Topper","Received as an extra in a trade with malfunxion. First time trying this - and as advised from The Alchemist, I drank it straight from the can. The artwork on the can draws you in to that first sip. Taste is a perfect blend of hops with very little bitterness; delicious. Well done, but best beer in the world? No way."
"Heady Topper","So I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it packs a deceiving kick. Though I do think this is a great beer for hop heads and I do enjoy massive doses of that piny spicy flower I am not sure I could give this a 100. Great yes but a 100 no. The best beer not to me."
"Heady Topper","Appearance- Hazy darkish yellow coloration. Strong white foamy head, but dissipates quickly."
"Heady Topper","Appearance - Even though you are supposed to drink from the can i poured a little bit out just to get a look at it. Pours a very light orange, with almost no head. "
"Heady Topper","Yup. The hype gets so intense that there is often a rogue wave of backlash to counter its momentum. It was in this mind frame of slightly lowered expectations that I had my first sip of this admittedly outstanding beverage."
"Heady Topper","Had this in a can (well, a couple of cans) in Burlington, VT. Stores all around were completely sold out but there were a few pubs on Church Street that still had them in stock. "
"Heady Topper","This beer is all hype. Most of the people that love this beer don't live in VT. This is not even they best IPA or DIPA in VT."
"Heady Topper","I drank from the can so it's hard to judge appearance, but the can looks super sexy. "
"Heady Topper","Brew: The Alchemist Heady Topper"
"Heady Topper","Solid, really, really solid. Great beer. Lots of citrus and piney hops bursting through the can. Extremely smooth and delicious going down. Smooth, really smooth."
"Heady Topper","A: (Sure, Alchemist tells you to drink straight from the can, but how can you review appearance when you do that? I'm a f**king rebel. I drink it from my IPA glassware) If kept in proper temp, this should look translucent and dark orange to you. No suspension, no settlement (if you see protein settlement, you kept it for too long!)"
"Heady Topper","What can you really say now? The only thing that the nose isn't as floral as some other IPA'S and doubles I have had."
"Heady Topper","Hmmm, what can I say? It's one of the best beers I have had the joy of drinking. Everything from the presentation of the can, the four pack little plastic holder thingy, to the fact that it's a pounder can, just makes it that much more special."
"Heady Topper","I have had this beer multiple times and I just can't get enough. "
"Heady Topper","DRINK FROM THE CAN! All caps, all bold, and topped off with an exclamation point. How does one disregard such a declaration? Furthermore, how do you rate appearance on a beer you can't see? Well, I cheated and poured some out. Nice, rich orange body, not too much head. But since it's the can that's truly making the appearance, let's talk about the can. The can is awesome. The dude with the outburst of hops from his cranium: terrific. And I'm partial to the message on the back: ""Don't Be A D-Bag, Recycle This Can."" "
"Heady Topper","Had to pour out a little from the can despite the warning just to see the color. Carmel/amber in color. The nose is so fresh, full of citrus fruits and piney hops! No surprise here, that's pretty much the taste on the palate also. Quite a hop punch to this DIPA, excellent balance and acidity, alcohol masked well. Unbelievably drinkable and just so damn fresh. It's like I'm chewing on a hop cone. They say it's the water that makes this special but whatever it is, keep doing it. I hope they begin to distribute because getting a can of this in NYC was hard. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop head. It's a tough call, but I think this might top the all mighty Pliney!"
"Heady Topper","Perfection. The best. Anyone who likes beer must drink this before at least once. I am lucky enough to have family near Waterbury, Vermont. I'm not a big IPA fan, but this is certainly the best beer you will ever hope to try. I especially love that it is only in cans."
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can as instructed, but I prefer it from a glass. The nose  is fantastic and the tastes lines up with you smell. Hoppy, tropical and smooth."
"Heady Topper","A - hazy yellow sunshine, moderate to heavy lacing, inch of froth"
"Heady Topper","A - Really nice can - catchy but not flashy. Beer itself is a rich tan color - looks scrumptious. Perfect head. "
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into...wait...not pouring it anywhere. "
"Heady Topper","Brought all the way to Montana from Vermont... extremely excited to try this."
"Heady Topper","My first BA review... here goes.."
"Heady Topper","Finally got my hands on a can after all this time. Poured into my SN Liettich Balloon glass despite the ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"" text on the can. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head. This is exactly what a DIPA should look like. Smell is of citrus and mango. The smell out of the can is just amazing. Best part of this beer. Taste follows the nose. Just in-your-face juicy hops. Fruity, citrusy, a little pine. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, which makes for a very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA. Mouthfeel is great. I always say with a juicy IPA you need a fuller mouthfeel and this is exactly what I mean. Overall, a great DIPA, one of the best. Would I go way out of my way to get it again? Probably not but it's something everyone needs to try at least once."
"Heady Topper","Amazing beer, I have about two 4 packs left over from my trip to Burlington left over. I don't have enough time on this site to post a trade, but am willing to do so. The beer is as good as claimed and I have enjoyed them since returning home to Toledo, OH where these beers are not available."
"Heady Topper","Perfect gold color (though you're not supposed to pour it out of the can), extremely aromatic, very strong, rich, robust flavor - even with the 6 hops, the taste is not overpoweringly bitter as some traditional IPAs, but is extremely smooth and refreshing."
"Heady Topper","An amazing IPA. Quite bitter, but a really nice balance of hop profiles between resinous, citrusy, and fruity. Consumed out of the can and out of the glass, no substantial difference."
"Heady Topper","Incredible, re-visiting this one and there is not much here to dislike.  "
"Heady Topper","definitely worth the hype, if you can get it. Only sold near the brewery in VT. The aromas flowing out of this beer are tremendous. You won't be disappointed. I have only tried a few of them, but will definitely be searching for more. Good alcohol level. Go find it and try it!"
"Heady Topper","A big thank you to markgugs for this one! Looks like this was canned 4-29-14"
"Heady Topper","Ok there really isn't much I can add the the rep of this beer but rather than just ticking for the sake of ticking,  I'll leave a comment. "
"Heady Topper","2nd time trying this one and even better than I remember. The balance is amazing. Was fortunate enough to try a couple PTE's last year as well, but Heady beats it no contest.  Can't wait to get back East in the spring and hopefully track some more down!"
"Heady Topper","Drank in the can."
"Heady Topper","it doesn't take alot of words to describe this beer because it's near perfect."
"Heady Topper","A: The website made me categorize this even though it tells you to drink from the can. The can's art is kinda nice..."
"Heady Topper","A: A very light orange, almost yellow, and quite cloudy."
"Heady Topper","Dear beer drinking community,"
"Heady Topper","Purchased during almost monthly trips to Vermont. Drink out of can and out of tulip and occasionally from tap."
"Heady Topper","Acquired via trade at DLD. Shared witha buddy."
"Heady Topper","Can from HopSynonymous."
"Heady Topper","This heady topper is about 3 weeks old which is about the peak in my opinion. The very fresh stuff is a little off to me. "
"Heady Topper","It's hard to be number one, and only be sold in Vermont...thanks again to cwelsh55 for the beer trade. Stand up dude, who drove 7 hours each way from outside of Philly to track down this highly sought after beer. Looks great in a glass took sip from the can but didn't think it would do the beer justice after that first sip. "
"Heady Topper","Serving Type - Can"
"Heady Topper","Finally got to try the #1 beer so thought I would write a review! Appearance is great, unfiltered and good yello/gold color. Smell is amazing with great hops coming through. Taste is where I am disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's good but not as hoppy as I was expecting. Can't tell but missing something. And mouthful was just alright. Overall a good beer but feel like I've had better IPAs out there."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to Dr. DmanGTR for this brew!!!! "
"Heady Topper","Ok, I have been waiting to taste this one for a long time now. One of customers, who has in in depth knowledge of all sorts of beers, brought one 4 pack in for me to try. He was heading up to Vermont, so he was going to buy some more."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: cloudy, pale, golden straw color."
"Heady Topper","Drinking straight from the can, as instructed."
"Heady Topper","Love it so much. Wave after wave indeed, it doesn't stop being good and filling your mouth. "
"Heady Topper","A: it pours a straw color with an orangy tan head."
"Heady Topper","I won't make this a complicated review. I will tell you that his beer lived up to the hype for me. We all have different palates so I'm not going to try and tell you what I smell and taste other than the fact that this beer, to my palate was ridiculously smooth, incredibly drinkable, and had a great finish. Continue your mission to find it. You won't be disappointed."
"Heady Topper","Poured half into a tulip glass to compare can vs glass, beer is a light yellowish gold, quite cloudy and hazy with a good white head and lacing. Looks fantastic."
"Heady Topper","This is a great huge balanced IPA. Does not have the drinkaablity of Pliny but if you are loking for a wham in your face IPA with some malt backbone this is the best. Huge citrus and pine flavors very overhemling. medium to medium high mouthfeel. Not a hot weather IPA, would go great and standup with very spicy foods. Love the can and artwork."
"Heady Topper","I know I'm supposed to drink from the can, but I just can't bring myself to do it. Heady pours a hazy light copper with a fluffy head that lingers as beautiful lacing on the glass. Pine, citrus and fresh cut grass fill the aroma. Especially when fresh, this beer is the closest thing to sticking your nose into a handful of hops. Thick, resiny hops fill the flavor, but there is almost more sweetness than bitterness upfront. Delicious light malt rounds out the intense, fruity, citrusy hops. The resiny, piney character lingers on the tongue in the after taste, and begs me to take another sip. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks Dan (CaptCleveland) for including this as an extra. Only bosses do that. "
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can"
"Heady Topper","Must admit, lives up to the hype. Best canned beer I've had. Poured in a pint glass. Great lacing! Full bodied beer with an upfront intense hoppiness. Just the right balance of pine and citrus. Soft on the palate with a hint of caramel for finish. Liquid GOLD!"
"Heady Topper","Lives up to the hype. Had it in can as instructed. Also worth trying in an IPA glass if you have enough of them to experiment. High alcohol content without losing its smoothness is one of its many impressive traits. Listen to the advice to drink asap. I had one several months old and the decline was noticeable. Enjoy."
"Heady Topper","A- amazing honey color hazy with a tinge of orange very little head little glass lacing one of the prettiest beers ive ever looked at"
"Heady Topper","so I have to pour it into a glass to see its appearance... right? first drink is out of the can, as recommended, and very nice. first drink is also just after the Pliny, for comparison purposes... hazy and unfiltered, my brain is saying ""hefe!"" dark, hazy yellow, some head from a soft pour. fragrant. some lemon. as someone else said, ""rich, creamy citrus nose..."" perfect description. and I liked this description also: ""silkier and thicker unfiltered mouthfeel..."" this is very good; I can see why it is compared to Pliny. both are very legendary brews.... I cant say one is better, it always fits your mood at the time, right? a little sweet, a little biscuit, very very beautiful... i'm happy to have tried this. I wonder how it tastes fresh?"
"Heady Topper","Can to snifter, although just out the can is great."
"Heady Topper","appearance: poured a bit into a glass to get a look and drinking the rest from the can as advised. Cloudy medium gold. Nice enough white head, messy lacing that doesn't stick around long. Pretty enough though I guess looks aren't what this guy is all about."
"Heady Topper","The hype is real and so is the beer. I was lucky enough to get my hands on two cases at two seperate times and the biggest concern was drinking it and not having any left, but I didnt want it to sit around! "
"Heady Topper","I was lucky enough to visit the cannery before it was closed to the public and have been able to get a few cans of Heady from various friends since then. Every time I have one, it's a borderline religious experience."
"Heady Topper","So this is my first review as I am new to BA. I have been drinking this beer for sometime. My profile picture is off my trunk leaving Waterbury VT, I found a place that didn't have a case limit (like most do) so my trip was very productive."
"Heady Topper","I should have reviewed this beer by now, but these reviews are hard to write while you've been imbibing."
"Heady Topper","Long-awaited taste of this beer was well-worth the wait. To put it simply: This is an awesome brew! It is much hoppier than I expected, but this was a pleasant surprise to be sure. It was a great overall experience right from the can. I highly recommend this one, along with virtually everyone else who has had the benefit of enjoying it."
"Heady Topper","The hype is well deserved! I love Heady Topper so much that I feel the need to drive 18 hours to get more."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper....one of my beer drinking milestones....i've wanted to try this beer for a while,and it finally came available in my area....Poured from the can inyo an IPA glass....Absolutely lives up to the hype"
"Heady Topper","Had to drink a quarter from the can... Poured the rest gently into a glass."
"Heady Topper","It says drink from the can but I poured it anyway for appearence reasons. Very west coast style, up there with the best of IPA's I have had. Wonderfully juicy and very refreshing, if it weren't 8% I could easily drink a sixer of it. Only had once since I am living in PA but will search out again"
"Heady Topper","I am not, I repeat NOT, a hop head. This was the beer that changed my opinion of IPA's. So I guess it's fair to say I wasn't a hop head. The aroma is what first got me. Like a bowl of freshly cut tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is down right dairy-like. Creamy and not too thin. There is a perfect balance of bitterness and malty undertones. I live 5 hours (10 round trip) from the nearest retailer and I regularly make the trip to obtain HT. If you get the chance, don't pass it up."
"Heady Topper","This has been on my wants list for almost 2 years. I am going to try to be as open minded. If you would have told me 5 years ago that the #1 beer in the world would be from a can I would have said you were crazy. Lets see."
"Heady Topper","Heady topper is an ipa perfected. The hop profile imparts a perfect flavor without being overly bitter. The alchemist does a phenomenal job crating a perfect ipa for us hop heads that love the flavor of hops but may not care for the bitterness all the time."
"Heady Topper","A friend brought this to me on a recent trip to Vermont."
"Heady Topper","The one definitely lived up to the hype. Tried it on a ""can-share"" with some friends. Nose was incredible, despite my initial distaste for IPA's. This helped me cross over to the hop side because the taste was not overwhelmingly bitter, but rather pleasant with pine and citrus flavors. A beer I hope to have another opportunity to sip on soon!"
"Heady Topper","2 months old"
"Heady Topper","Drank this in the recommended can so it's difficult to rate the appearance. I gave it a 4 knowing that it's unfiltered."
"Heady Topper","This beer is fantastic! Every time I have it I am amazed at how smooth it is for the it's ABV. The taste is extremely complex and refreshing. I can't help but feel like I'm pouring an IPA through a bouquet of fresh hops directly into my mouth. Hands down a beer to get your hands on if you happen to come by it."
"Heady Topper","The is an outstanding DIPA. I could drink this all day everyday. A perfect DIPA for the novice as well and the Beer Geek"
"Heady Topper","A - When I did pour this one into a glass, I was surprised at how good it looked. I'd heard it was scary to view in a glass. It is a fine looking brew...but not as deep golden as other DIPAs."
"Heady Topper","L: What a beautiful can!"
"Heady Topper","Had this tonight on tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury and can at my B&B in Stowe (the owner gets free misprints and gives them to guests on arrival if they're beer geeks)"
"Heady Topper","It's Heady . . . what else can I say ?"
"Heady Topper","Got this beer from a friend in New Hampshire."
"Heady Topper","I've had this a few times. This is the most bitter thing I have tasted, but surprisingly you quickly get accustomed to it, and actually enjoy it. "
"Heady Topper","4/2/14 – consumed 5/5/14. Thanks to Scalawags for this awesome beer."
"Heady Topper","Can to glass"
"Heady Topper","Based on the last few cans of Heady Topper that I've had I have to down grade the rating a bit.  I wish there was a better way of distinguishing which year or version of Heady Topper this is because it's not the same as it once was. Having said that, I did a blind tasting on 8/29/14 with the recent batches of Focal Banger, Rapture, The Crusher and Heady Topper."
"Heady Topper","X x x x x x"
"Heady Topper","I finally found a hookup that could get me these on a regular basis. Man, it was worth the effort. The Alchemist seriously nailed it. This beer is damn near the perfect IPA. For this big of an IPA the bitterness, or lack thereof is notable. The hops just keep coming. I read that there was some oatmeal added for mouthfeel. I get it. Perfect. Seriously, it's oneof the best IPA's I've ever had."
"Heady Topper","Cant believe i havent reviewed this before. Half way through a can, nows the time..."
"Heady Topper","Poured into an IPA glass. Directly contrary to what the can says, I know, but it would be a shame not to see this beer. Super hazy pale orange color, with tons of bubbles rising up through the liquid, and a super thick off-white head that blankets the glass in lace as it slowly fades."
"Heady Topper","Big, fresh hop aromas right out of the can - tons of pine and some nice citrus. Flavor is quite bitter, yet beautifully balanced, managing to be easy drinking while still full-bodied and packing a huge hoppy punch. Great mouthfeel, nicely complex, very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Heady Topper","Drank it straight out of the can!"
"Heady Topper","Not 100% sure of the age, but my trader (TPSReport...big thanks) says it is about 3-4 weeks old. "
"Heady Topper","The pine hoppy smell and taste just makes you want more after every sip. Just make sure you're home or have a dd as this also gives a happy glow buzz. "
"Heady Topper","Had to revisit this beer as all my previous examples were gifted to me, and never completely fresh. So, took a trip to VT, and grabbed myself a fresh case. So I'm re-reviewing. "
"Heady Topper","Purchased 2.22.14 from the Montpelier Discount Beverage and Redemption Center."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into a pub glass."
"Heady Topper","I had one of these in Burlington, Vermont at a bar straight from the can."
"Heady Topper","Although residing in the west coast, I've had the pleasure of trying this beer multiple times due to awesome friends. The first time I had this beer it was split three-ways, poured into glasses. At that time i felt that this beer was overhyped and couldn't stand up to the likes of PtE. However upon having a can to myself, straight from the can, I can definitely see why HT is so highly regarded."
"Heady Topper","Did it live up to the hype?  No, nothing ever does.  Was it good?  Hell yeah!  I actually enjoyed my second one more as I knew what to expect.  This was was more of a hop juice than something like a west coast IPA.  I personally liked this with a couple of months on it more than fresh."
"Heady Topper","Lucky enough to find a local shop that gets it shipped by a Vermont local. This beer is amazing a few weeks old, I can only imagine how good it tastes fresh! Even though it says to enjoy out of the can I prefer it poured into a glass. Helps me capture the amazing aroma."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a glass yesterday at the Farmhouse Taphouse in Burlington yesterday. $8.00 to taste what is now a cult followed beer. I enjoyed enough to skip over to 240 Pearl Street and buy a case of 24 for roughly $88 USD. In case anybody wants to load up, delivery for Heady Topper is on Tuesday, so make sure you go when a delivery is imminent or shortly thereafter. Sitting around today and on my third can right now, and each one sheds more light on why this beer is so popular. It tastes light...fresh...and just bottom line - a real nice IPA."
"Heady Topper","What can I say about this beer, it is everything people say it is and the hype is spot on. Although, the level if IBU's have been consistent at times I can have one where the hoppiness really comes through while other times it is more gradual and the notes are released with perfection. I know that the brewery has other brews that it releases in limited quantities, but I hope they can try and produce the other options with a bit more releases then they currently offer. But no complaints they are staying true to their brew and ""Heady Topper"" is always on my list of brews that I would have on any given day."
"Heady Topper","This is an extremely, well-crafted beer. It is wonderfully balanced and well-hopped. Truly made by an Alchemist, or the devil himself."
"Heady Topper","I drank Heady Topper a couple times from cans only, never on tap. I thought it was a great beer but not the best in the world. If I went out to a pub and they had HT , I would order and drink it over probably others because it's so hard to get anywhere outside Vermont."
"Heady Topper","I have to say this is a really good beer. I also have to say it doesn't live up to the hype of being the best beer ever. With all these hyped beers I have noticed a trend:"
"Heady Topper","Although I've had this beer a few times, I figured it warranted a proper review. I can't do one of those, so I'll just write some words. Unfortunately, I think this can is 6 or 7 weeks old now. So not the best version of itself. "
"Heady Topper","Drank this right from the can as I was instructed. The nose smells like beer candy and the beer is creamy and hoppily delicious. This beer just does everything right, and honestly gets better with every sip. While it's not my favorite IPA I've ever had (Double Citra from Hill Farmstead currently wears that crown), this is absolutely wonderful and I would drink this every night if I could."
"Heady Topper","A - pours a cloudy burnt orange with a finger of off white foamy head. Foamy spotty clings to the glass after each sip. "
"Heady Topper","What's not to love about this beer? There are no compromises and makes no apologies. "
"Heady Topper","Appearance: amber or even an off gold colored, not really cloudy, just opaque enough not to be able to see through. "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper. Yes, the 'holy grail.'"
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed from a 16 oz can as instructed."
"Heady Topper","First off a big thank you to my friend Jim for this beer! I live in San Diego so this is really hard to find."
"Heady Topper","Simply the best beer made.  This beer astounds the senses.  The aroma teases one with the layers of flavors to follow.  Those flavors swarm the tongue with complexity-floral, tropical, juicy hops carried upon a perfectly balanced malt kiss of love."
"Heady Topper","I went into my first Heady Topper with great expectations. My friend, whose beer opinion I've trusted since the 7th grade, really talked great things about this beer. It really intrigued me about how good he said it was. So I decided to get my Google on and do some research. Every rating site I found gave it tremendous reviews. Thousands of reviews and all of them were extremely high ratings. I found myself determined to track this brew down!"
"Heady Topper","I love this freakin beer. Unlike some of the heavier/boozier top beers, this not only goes hand in hand with Pliny for best in class, but is a daily drinking beer too. Just wish it was more readily available so I could have it daily. If you ain't had it, get you some."
"Heady Topper","Am very lucky to have a steady supply due to my proximity to Waterbury. Due to that I am always looking forward to cracking the next heady that brings that delicious hoppy not to citrusy ipa smell to your nostrils. The taste is the most memorable i've ever had with the perfect bite to accompany it's 8% abv, making it impossible to not savor the last taste. Believe the hype."
"Heady Topper","A. Not sure I followed directions and drank it strait"
"Heady Topper","Poured a tiny bit into a glass just to get a look at it. Its unfiltered so it is meant to be cloudy and not too clean."
"Heady Topper","A fantastic Double IPA. It does however have a very sweet after taste. The reason this beer is rated so well is the genius marketing from the Alchemist Team. Cheers to you for that John! I am drinking this beer out of a glass right now, and I do have to say that they are deadly serious about it being better in the Can."
"Heady Topper","Taste and mouthfeel were spectacular. Hits your nose like a hammer straight to your olfactory senses. Do NOT pour this beer into a glass as it is to be enjoyed fresh from the can, doing so will result in little white specs in your beer leaving it to seem much less appealing."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip glass. Thanks to Elkevo for this!"
"Heady Topper","The best what else can u say but it is the BEST!!!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from 500ml can into a stemmed tulip glass (beer was 6 days old)"
"Heady Topper","S: My god, crack a can and you can smell it across the room. Immediate grapefruit, then pine, I can't detect the alcohol"
"Heady Topper","Citrus hits you hard when you crack open a can. The juicy hop flavors are layered in an interesting way so as to get something a bit different with every sip."
"Heady Topper","Typical Double IPA. Had a great crisp citrus taste to it. It was not as smooth as I thought it was going to be. Notice the hops more on the after tastes. cloudy appearance. In my opinion not worth all the hype. I can easily say there are so many better IPA's out on the market."
"Heady Topper","What can I say that hasn't been said already? Best beer in the Country. Often imitated, never fkn duplicated.   I've had all the ""best"" x times and none of them are the Topper.  This beer leaves you feeling like you just ate a fresh grapefruit. It leaves you wanting to crack another. I've had it out the can and out of a Tulip, and its just as good either way! GOD BLESS THE ALCHEMIST! You want the beer You're drinking now to be like this but just admit it... It's not!"
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a cloudy orange/yellow color with a half finger white head that dissipates to a light film, light lacing. "
"Heady Topper","been a member for a while now and visit the site frequently but have never written a review so i figured why not start here, after finally getting my hands on this gem. "
"Heady Topper","A long time coming for this review. Two of my great friends brought back 2 cases. I went into this the same way it sounds like a lot of people do. very excited BUT somewhat skeptical. How can everyone agree that this is one of the best beers no matter what your personal preference in style is? Well...just because it is. Luckily my favorite beers are imperial IPA's. The can says Heady Topper, but I almost instantly nick named it 'rolling thunder' for two reasons. 1. Its got a high ABV in a 16 oz serving. 2. because its rolling waves of super deep hop, after hop, after hop. Each wave releases a different flavor that ignites your mouth with an assertive force and refuses to leave after you're done drinking it. It takes about 5-10 minutes for it linger away. My favorite part of this wonder is the very middle. There becomes a blast of grapefruit dryness in the middle that is incredibly apparent. You might say its sweet because its a very bright flavor but its not sweet in any sugary artificial way. I think the moment when the middle grapefruit blast hits is the best because of the waves of pine and floral hops that come on the front, and back ends before you reach that middle peak explosion. It has an awesome body that you can really feel on your palate, and has an aromatic smell that you can not ignore."
"Heady Topper","I was expecting a party in my mouth when I had this beer. All I ended up with was just some good beer, no GREAT beer. I think the hype of this beer hurt the chances. I prefer a nice florally west coast IPA over this one note beer."
"Heady Topper","Ok so the beer is perfect. I have been drinking it for a while and it never disappoints nor does it become old. the flavors are always fresh tasting and always exciting. the first time I drank it it I poured it into a glass because I thought the ""Drink out of the can"" was hype. Incredible as the taste out of the glass was, it was otherworldly out of the can. The initial whiff of the hops when you pop it open is Ecstasy. The promise of a great beer to come delivers on your first sip and then the magic happens as each sip brings out different flavors from bitter to sweet back to bitter all in different stages. "
"Heady Topper","I do not like to ""believe the hype"" but Heady Topper did not disappoint. Did not drink out of the can. The color when poured in a glass is beautiful. The smell is very unique and the flavor holds true. One of my most important factors in tasting beers is the after taste. Heady just keeps going and going. Fantastic beer."
"Heady Topper","Received a 4-pack in a trade. Served chilled in the can, as per the manufactures instructions. "
"Heady Topper","The smoothest and easiest to drink 8%+ abv beer I've ever had. A magical experience - the pungent bitter hop flavor lingered long after finishing. There's a nice subtle grapefruit presence on the back end as well. Lucky me I have 12 more of these!"
"Heady Topper","Yellow/orange body with a fluffy white head."
"Heady Topper","I've been lucky enough to have this a few times and it's consistently one of the best IIPA's I've had. It's not some revelatory flavor that doesn't exist in any other beers, it's the combination of those flavors and how everything is perfectly balanced. It's the Goldilocks soup of beers, just right. "
"Heady Topper","A: pours an orangeish hazy color with a finger high head that leaves great lacing"
"Heady Topper","First of all, and I certainly won't be the first to say this, but I HATE drinking beer in cans. You do not see, you cannot smell correctly and it looks cheap! Anyway, I did obey what the can says and I did drink it out of the can. "
"Heady Topper","I don't know how beer can taste any better than this. I thought there was no way this could live up to the hype. Wrong."
"Heady Topper","A- although I drank this gorgeous elixir from the can, I watched as it was carefully poured into a tulip. Perfect orange-salmon haze with a prominent head and steady lacing."
"Heady Topper","A - pours beautiful hazy orange (I've poured it out and drank from that can, as advised). Amazing two finger head with slight lacing around the glass. A real work of art."
"Heady Topper","One of the best Double IPAs I've ever tasted. "
"Heady Topper","I'd forgotten about the ranty feeling-sorry-for-myself review from last August (Reposted below.) But I am here to report I finally hit Heady paydirt. That is, my friend BigStein88 gave me two precious cans. "
"Heady Topper","What is there to say about this beer that hasn't already said a million times?"
"Heady Topper","When you go against the advice on the can, it pours a hazy orange and has a bright white creamy head."
"Heady Topper","Thanks has to go to nedvalton, a most generous BA'er for hooking me up with my first Heady Topper. As soon as I popped the top on that shiny silver and black can I got blasted with the dankest, hoppiest, fruitiest, hop bombiest goodness I have ever experienced. There's just so much going on with the smell, that I am having a hard time nailing it down. Here goes nothing, grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, Bubblegum surf wax, I swear I'm getting that. This stuff smells exactly like I imagined it would after reading so many of the reviews on here, an absolute delight. I poured about half into a tulip glass so that I could get a good look at it. Pours a super hazy and resinous golden orange hue, minimal head and lacing. It smelled amazing in the can, but the complex aroma really opened up once poured, now I'm even more intrigued. My first sip and all I can say is, YES! Worth all the hype, 100 percent! I've had a few other beers that come real close to this, but the mouthfeel and balance along with the juicy aftertaste make this an absolute work of art in a can! With each sip it gets better and better, the bitterness isn't overwhelming at all, and couple that with the citrusy/fruity/floral undertones that coat your tongue, it's easy to forget that theres alcohol in there. Just like it says on the can ""so drinkable, it's scary"" Overall I can see why this beer is ranked #1, because it just became my #1 as well. Thank you nedvalton, and thank you Alchemist!"
"Heady Topper","Good head but quick dissipation, mild lacing. Cloudy and golden in appearance. Nose is mild-moderate in strength, fruity with no hint of dank-type hop aromas. Taste is very smooth, silky mouthfeel, with moderate-strong but not overwhelming hop profile. It's all peach and grapefruit with no dank character at all, more intense and complex as the beer warms. Only a mild suggestion of the heat in the finish. This is a great beer but perhaps not as world-class a beer as Pliny, in my humble opinion."
"Heady Topper","My can was said to be super fresh… poured into a New Belgium goblet the hazy and yeast debris was quite heavy. Otherwise, tawny-amber in hue with a sticky white head and plenty of subsequent lacing. "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is by far one of my favorite beers ever sampled. I've had it probably over 20 times, very hard to get, but they always happen to show up at our beer tastings. I'm not a huge fan of the amount of yeast/sediment in the bottom, but if you pour it just right into a pint glass you can avoid most of the sludge. Very hoppy and very flavorful."
"Heady Topper","Had drank from can except for a little bit to get appearance "
"Heady Topper","This is easily the best DIPA or IPA that has ever come across my palette. Not being a fan of particularly hoppy beer, I was hesitant that this would be too much for me. I'm pleased that I gave it the chance it deserved. I've now opened up to these complex and floral offerings. Heady Topper is the gold standard. The pure evergreen-ness of this beer perfectly conveys the woods where it is brewed. Well done Alchemist."
"Heady Topper","16oz can. Drank it straight from the can. I did pour just a tiny bit in a small glass to get the appearance."
"Heady Topper","My first post on BA. While a seasoned IPA drinker, this beer is simply the best. I have recently had FRESH GROWLERS OF firestone union jack, sierra nevvada torpedo, nugget necctar, Hop Stupid, Hop Nosh, etc... it had been 2 months since my last heady topper. Very Lucky to have a friend pick me up 12 of these unreal IPA's . while I like hoppy beers I like balanced IPA's not overly bitter. . This beer is perfect. Drinkability is unreal for an 8% IPA. Flavor is fruity but not overly so, hoppy, but not overly so, simply the best. No contest."
"Heady Topper","Pours a beautiful hazy and golden light orange.  The nose jumps out of the can as soon as you crack it open.  A bouquet of hops tickle your nose hairs.  Wave after wave of hops delicately balanced with malts overtake your palate.  Drinks really easily for 8% and has a fantastic finish."
"Heady Topper","Easily the best beer I have had the good fortune to taste, so it is appropriate that it be my first review on BA. Living in NH, my close proximity has allowed me to enjoy it fairly regularly. A wonderful smelling beer that when fresh can literally fill a room with a floral citrus hop aroma. It pours with a nice head, and has a typical cloudy appearance in the glass for the style. The alcohol is well masked. This beer has a nice balance of heavy citrus hops and bitterness. My only wish is that the alchohol content were a little less so I could enjoy more than one in an evening. However, it is the kind of beer you can drink slowly and savor each sip. If you have not had it, make a trade to get it, as it deserves the #1 rating it currently holds."
"Heady Topper","If you are a person who likes hops this is a beer for you. This beer is a nicely brewed DIPA which explodes your palate. a well balanced floral/fruit aroma and hoppiness flavor and a citrus bite to it. overall this was a great beer. if you can get your hands on this beer you'll be in heaven."
"Heady Topper","Outstanding. This beer was a about a month and a half old, but was still extremely hoppy and fragrant. I can only imagine how much better it would have been if it were fresher. Nevertheless, this was a great beer. Kudos Alchemist Brewery, ku-fucking-dos."
"Heady Topper","Heady topper has all that a hop lover would appreciate and more. The unfiltered, strong flavor of the hops overpowers the flavor of the alcohol. This beer recommends that you drink it from the can to allow unfiltered parts at the bottom to remain. The most flavorful and delicious beer of this type that I have had."
"Heady Topper","Top beer. Although it says drink from the can, I enjoy it from a glass much better. Full grapefruit smell. High hop taste. Mouthfeel is OK. Little to no bitter aftertaste. Ages ok, but best fresh. Got mine from the brewery before they closed the retail shop."
"Heady Topper","A- Cloudy, golden, 1/2 inch collar of foam"
"Heady Topper","I'm honestly not sure what all the hype is about. I think the fact that it's hard to get and really hoppy makes it a winner in most people's books. For me though it had a weird background taste every sip that I wasn't really used to I guess. After about the 3rd or 4th can though I started to like the beer a lot more."
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can."
"Heady Topper","Serving: Out of the can as instructed by Alchemist Brewery"
"Heady Topper","Served cold from a 16 oz can into a 7 oz taster. This is contrary to instruction from the brewer to drink straight from the can."
"Heady Topper","Is there really a perfect beer? Absolutely!! This was well worth the wait. I got my hands on 2 4-packs and opened one as soon as I got home. "
"Heady Topper","Finally had a chance to get my hands on a can of HT. Poured into a glass, even though it says to drink from the can. The aroma of this beer is fantastic. Very floral and pleasant. First sip was no different. It's a very unique Imperial IPA. Not over bearing with the hops but you know they're there. Very smooth and easy to drink, which is dangerous for an Imperial IPA. I wish this stuff wasn't so hard to get because I'd have a fridge full of it right now. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to the DreamWeaver. Word on the street is this can is approximately 3 weeks old. Not ideal, but I'm not complaining (too much.)"
"Heady Topper","As close to a perfect beer as you can get. It lives up to the hype. You can drink it ice cold, even warm and it will still tastes great. The first thing I noticed was the excellent aroma. This is a really hoppy beer but not bitter at all. My favorite beer to date."
"Heady Topper","Took ski trip this weekend to burlington area with a stop at the hunger mountain coop to grab a few cases to take back to new york. Hunger Mountain Coop is the place to go for Cases but generally sells out in a few hours so you have to time it right. "
"Heady Topper","I have only had this beer a handful of times.... ok, I lied, I've had it twice... This is a beer a plan my day around to drink because it is just that good and that rare I get to drink it, regardless of how hard I try to get it."
"Heady Topper","I had this at Revolution Kitchen, a primarily vegan restaurant in Burlington. I'd heard all the hype about Heady and was, to say the least, cynical. Well, put me down as a believer."
"Heady Topper","Wow, what a beer."
"Heady Topper","The legends are true. This is an especially tasty, and dense IPA. "
"Heady Topper","Look - well, I drink this beer out of the can per the instructions - can is nice to look at, but going to give this the same as the overall score.  Smell - Citrus (orange and grapefruit) - clean small.  Taste seems to alternate between orange and grapefruit on the front. Malty finish as described."
"Heady Topper","Murkiest beer I've ever poured. I can see why they want you to drink from the can."
"Heady Topper","16oz. can! This one pours a cloudy darker golden color. There a few floaties in there. Small white head that doesn’t linger long but does leave some lacing. Big nose of hops, hops and more hops! Grapefruit is the main contributor. Maybe some pineapple, peach and orange in there too. Nothing else making past the hops. The taste is good. Not nearly as bitter as you think it might be. Nice rounded flavor, fairly bitter, but there is a touch of sweetness hiding in there. Grapefruit and pine hops, with a strong malt body behind it. I’d say it definitely lives up to the hype. Now to get some more..."
"Heady Topper","Was finally able to track down through a trade, can't wait to try it! Had first quarter in can to experience it and then poured into tulip to compare."
"Heady Topper","Well here it is. Heady Topper. Poured into a tulip glass (we are trying to culture the yeast, so no drinking out of the can.)"
"Heady Topper","the best DIPA i have ever tasted. poured a little into a snifter glass to view appearance: very hazy almost imposable to see through. smells very dank. the mouthful is very heavy and filling. finish is perfect! if you can get your hands on this beer it is a must have!"
"Heady Topper","Finally had the chance to try one while skiing at Sugarbush and I must say, it is worth the hype. That first sip speaks for itself. Hints of citrus with a smooth body that is not too overwhelmingly hoppy. The beer is surprisingly refreshing while retaining a nice hoppy taste and a strong full flavour. The perfect beer to have after skiing and I was very content having only one. The next day i had another one and the quality was equally impressive. A great beer to drink slowly and enjoy as each sip reveals a unique taste. Easily the best double IPA i have tried and one of the only beers where i can honestly say that less is more. Saviour it while you drink it and you will totally be impressed!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can into a Alchemist Heady Stemless glass. Saved the last few ounces in the can and wow it does taste great out of the can. Get a lot more citrus from it."
"Heady Topper","Gift from a fellow BA in NC"
"Heady Topper","Canned: Don't see a date"
"Heady Topper","So I got to try the number 1 rated beer on beeradvocate.com"
"Heady Topper","This is a treat. "
"Heady Topper","I visited the brewery several months ago. I was impressed with the area. I think I could live there for a little while. The can says to drink it out of the can; so you can get the full deal. I agree, I did smell the beer better while it was in the can. Everyone claims to get a ton of peach flavor, but I really didn't. I got more pineapple/citrus. But Still a great brew. "
"Heady Topper","Received a can from a neighbor that hales from Vermont. As instructed by the can, I did NOT pour but drank directly from the can."
"Heady Topper","Served in the can for the smell and taste then poured rest in glass for appearance."
"Heady Topper","A - beautiful bright light orange, cloudy, nice two finger white head and lacing all over on the drink down."
"Heady Topper","Finally made it to the Holy Grail. Gratefully, the experience took place in a true Mecca location...Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont -- appropriately, the very site of The Alchemist's original brewery (prior to Hurricane Irene). In any event, as my good friend Khalil Saliba and I saddled up to the bar here (on Tuesday night, 1/28/14) and nervously ordered the first Heady Topper of our lives, the excitement was noticeably palpable. Hell, I almost shit my pants when the lovely bartendress set the beautiful tulip glass down in front of me. Awesome 2-finger head, which dissipated very slowly. Beautiful, cloudy orange/amber color, with expected cloudiness. Tremendous sticky lacing throughout. The nose was an incredible citrus pine of grapefruit, with hints of orange/mango/tangerine, all of which was replicated on the palate. But perhaps the most remarkable aspect, and (I believe) the signature of the HT experience, was the stupendous balance between the citrusy hops and the chewy malts throughout, with no heat of alcohol evident whatsoever which, along with the lovely, full mouthfeel, makes this beer outrageously easy to drink."
"Heady Topper","Can from Winooski."
"Heady Topper","American double/Imperial IPA"
"Heady Topper","This is the best DIPA I have ever had. Piney, grapefruit, citrus, sweet. All these flavors in perfect harmony. Some how there is a hop bitterness but also refreshing. There is just so much balance in this can. Nothing is overwhelming or outshining the overall balance of the beer."
"Heady Topper","I have been wanting to try this for quite a while now. So many people I know are always telling me this is the best. Well, I have to agree with them. As soon as I cracked the tab on the can the beautiful aroma overwhelmed me and the taste of this beer is so delicious and it is so smooth and citrusy....wow !!!! Definitely worth the wait and highly recommended for any IPA lover !!!!"
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed 1/2 out of can and 1/2 out of ipa glass! "
"Heady Topper","Drinking straight from the can. Have poured it into a glass before, but definitely prefer the can. As soon as I crack it open you smell all the hops. Pine. Citrus. Big grapefruit aroma.I miss going to the brewery and smelling all the hops. Smells so fresh. A ton of hops on the flavor. All the stuff in the aroma comes through and coats the tongue with a wave of pine and citrus. So resonious. Nice carbonation, as well. Mouthfeel is where this beer shines. Such a great beer and absolutely worth seeking out."
"Heady Topper","Nothing out of the ordinary here. Heady is what everyone makes it out to be, the best DIPA around."
"Heady Topper","Poured about 3oz into a snifter for appearance and smell, taste, feel, and overall are from the can"
"Heady Topper","trade extra from SloppyJoeWasAMan"
"Heady Topper","from the can, this beer is just incredible, what can be said that hasnt already been said. If you love hops jump right in and take a bath. great complexity pineapple up front, citrus galore, piney and juicy all they way through. every sip makes you think of something different, there is so much going on with this beer its impossible to capture in words or in one sip, so grab a few cases."
"Heady Topper","Consumed right from the can, because The Alchemist told me to, and I'm not about to second guess that magnificent man."
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from the can. "
"Heady Topper","From notes 11.28.13:"
"Heady Topper","Received in a trade from Liquidswordz. Thanks!"
"Heady Topper","I can't say enough about this beer, I've been drinking it consistently for over a year now, I'm from Vermont so I grab a case every Monday. I never felt the need to review it until now. As I said, I drink Heady Topper quite a bit, but this last weekend, I had the pleasure to taste it against Lawson's Double Sunshine, Dogfish 75 Min IPA, Pliny the Elder, and Hill Farmstead's Abner, and for the first time since I've been drinking Heady Topper, it had competition. I love Harpoon IPA and drink it regularly, but after a Heady Topper it's tastes like Bud Light. "
"Heady Topper","16 oz. aluminum can with two pours into a snifter glass"
"Heady Topper","Tangerine, pineapple, light mango, some resin, light bread, medium bitterness, clean sweet malt"
"Heady Topper","I was concerned that this would under deliver. Gladly it truly lives up to the hype. Beautiful pour. I split this pour into a sampling glass from the Garden State BrewFest and straight from the can, as suggested. Loved it all the way through. This improved with every sip. The last sip was the best as all the goodness remaining at the bottom of the can and mixes with each tip of the can."
"Heady Topper","A- Breaking their #1 rule, I sometimes pour this into a glass. (Alchemist prints ""Drink from the Can"" on the outside of every can) Its too good not to experience the site of it in a glass! "
"Heady Topper","I've been lucky enough to grab a can of Heady Topper through a friend who did a trade for it, otherwise I wouldn't have had the sheer pleasure of tasting this beauty. Living near the ""Hop Highway"", I'm used to good IPAs near me. Put this one up there with Pliny and Enjoy By, which are the best IPAs that I can easily get."
"Heady Topper","I've tasted a fair amount of beer to this point in my life. This beer is by far the best beer I've had the privilege to enjoy. It has a very hoppy aroma, so strong in fact you can smell it in your car with the windows rolled up as you're arriving to the brewery in Waterbury, VT. It has a fantastic hoppy flavor as well."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into a pint glass. Trader told me this is about 6 weeks old so not the freshest but I'm not as worried about canned IPAs as far as age goes, as long as it's not super crazy old. "
"Heady Topper","Served from can (duh) into a belgian glass."
"Heady Topper","I was luck enough to land six in a trade recently and enjoyed 3 of them. One in the can, one in a glass, and one where I poured a few ounces into a glass at a time. Overall, best IPA/IIPA I've ever had. I'm still having olfactory hallucinations about the massive tropical fruit, mainly pineapple, aromas this beer displays. I will be trading for moe of this soon. Well worth the effort and lives up to all the hype."
"Heady Topper","A- Orange in color, with a good clingy IPA head. "
"Heady Topper","originally 4.25 on 1/11/14"
"Heady Topper","Searching for the holy grail of beer, brought me to Vermont. Found 12 cans at hunger mountain coop, will taste from the can as well. Continued the pilgrimage to the prohibition pig. Ordered heady toppers for me and son #2 whilst waiting for a table."
"Heady Topper","First off..gotta thank Rich at South Bay Beverage in Massapequa,NY..he gave me Heady for FREE..he knew i was looking for it and had some he was drinking for himself,not for sale..so props to Rich.."
"Heady Topper","Been waiting to try this beer for a looong time. It was worth the wait. "
"Heady Topper","Been looking forward to this for a long time. Drove up to Vermont to get me a case. Yes it was worth the trip. Had one on Tap when in Waterbury. I had my first one from the case out of the can as directed the next day I had one from a tulip glass. was impressed with the smell or nose both ways. The appearance is the weak link here. Not ugly but a little hazy you might say. Dose not effect my felling towards the beer at all though but I scored it a 4,25 to be true. "
"Heady Topper","A kind of ugly beer - I see why they suggest drinking it from the can. Pours a hazy orange with a little sediment and not much in the way of head action. The aroma is fruity - tropical, with some apricot and mango. The flavor follows suit, with mango, apricot, pineapple, and a blast of big sticky hops. The mouthfeel is big and round. This beer is at once unusual and familiar - it reminds me of the beer to which it is so often compared, Pliny the Elder, though it is bigger and fuller, both in its tropical fruit and rounder mouthfeel. It's clearly less dry than the Russian River beer. But curiously the West Coast beer to which it most closely compares, in my view, is Racer 5 from Bear Republic - they are different beers, but both are round, fruity and given to showing up with a thick orange haze. It is as if Racer 5 and Pliny crashed into one another and spawned some crazy new hybrid. Heady Topper is a very good beer, but I wonder whether the frenzy would be as great if it were produced in greater quantity and distributed more widely."
"Heady Topper","A: Poured a hazy yellowish orange with a white head."
"Heady Topper","Believe the hype!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can (oops) into a dimpled mug. Pours a cloudy orange-straw colour with a foamy white head."
"Heady Topper","Crack open the can and smell the hops then take a sip, heaven. "
"Heady Topper","Drank a few of these from the can as instructed to by the labeling. I just couldn't resist pouring it into a pint glass for the next round."
"Heady Topper","Served in a becker pint glass. Second dance with this highly regarded beer, reviewed from notes."
"Heady Topper","This offering from The Alchemist is fantastic, the nose is super herbal and spicy aromatic from the hops. Sweet syrupy mouthfeel with a soft piney hop bite in the finish. Very balanced as stated on the can making this very enjoyable. One of the better IIPA's on the market."
"Heady Topper","Appearance- Only poured about an ounce as this one is supposed to be enjoyed from the can. Pours a hazy golden orange, decent sized white head for the pour and moderate lacing. Quite hazy but the can states that it is the intention."
"Heady Topper","BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
"Heady Topper","As a VTer, I have been fortunate to purchase this on a regular basis directly from the brewery."
"Heady Topper","Purchased and consumed many times over the past couple of years.  I typically ignore the can and drink from a tall glass.  "
"Heady Topper","Got my hands on a case while visiting VT, absolutely fantastic beer that lived up to the hype. "
"Heady Topper","Pours out a nice orange in color in color with a small white head that dissipated quick. Smell is really fruity with orange, mango, and pineapple with a little a tiny bit of malt but it is so in the background that the hops are the forefront. Taste is really fruity with all that was in the nose but there is a tiny bit more bitter hops in the background that sits in the mouth and really meld well with all he other stuff going on. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick for the style and really adds a lot to the beer. Overall this is an amazing beer that is hopped so well that it's a very hard beer to beat for the style. It is world class!!!"
"Heady Topper","FINALLY!! Had the elusive Heady Topper!! Now at first, I wanted to come at this beer with an open mind. After all the hype and the talk about this beer, I cracked my first can. BAM! The aroma hits my nose. The floral, citrusy hoppyness enters my face holes. I take the first sip...let the beer move around my mouth. THIS BEER LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!!! Absolutely delicious from beginning to end. After my first few sips I sat there and just smelled it over and over to let that beautiful hoppyness permeate. great finish to the beer, tons of hops and floral tastes along with a sort of citrus/fruitiness. The hardest thing about this beer is keeping it in my fridge. Don't let anyone know you have this beer if you really want to savor it, because people will ask to drink one. And I'm not willing to share right now."
"Heady Topper","I decided to turn a recent ski vacation on a BeerSKI vacation. Took a trip to Montpellier for a crazily hectic search for this magical nectar. The process of finding HT, and trying to beat out other people in the parking lot to the next case made the first cracking of the can that much more rewarding. After all, this beer is incredible"
"Heady Topper","My son brought us a bottle of fresh Pliney the Elder for Christmas. I've heard so much about the beer and it certainly lived up to the hype. Talk about fresh-it was bottled 10 days earlier! Immediate grassy, fresh hop aroma followed by the most fresh IPA hop flavor! The flavor seemed to intensify as it warmed up a bit. Clean, refreshing finish. Simply amazing."
"Heady Topper","I have had many hoppy beers....but this one takes the cake. "
"Heady Topper","A: hazy golden, i want to jump in"
"Heady Topper","Finally got to try. My can is under a week old. In my book this stuff absolutely lives up to the hype. A perfect hop forward IPA. I prefer it in the glass so I can admire the color and the smell. It appears a murky yellow / orange almost resembling juice. The smell is hops and more hops. Taste just like it smells - awesome! This is the real deal!!!"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can as instructed..."
"Heady Topper","A - The beer is medium shaded yellow with a dense white head. "
"Heady Topper","The alchemist Deserves Credit For Focusing On Their Only Beer And making It perfect And Out Of A Can! It Is unfiltered But Color Is Consistent Surpringly Small Head For Something Named Heady Topper. It Is Very Smooth great Complexity Of flavor And You Could Drink A Lot And Forget It is 8% . A Cult Like Following And Hard To Find."
"Heady Topper","Received in trade from Bricenice, Thanks Mike!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into a tulip."
"Heady Topper","Tried it at the brewery on tap, tried it from the can 1 day old, and tried it from the can 6 months old."
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed once before and once after an 8 mile mountain trail run."
"Heady Topper","I just tried this beer for the first time, and I have to say I'm impressed. Against my better judgement, I followed the directions on the can and decided to drink it without pouring it into my tulip."
"Heady Topper","Amazing beer, have had it many times as it is locally available. If it is more than 2 weeks old it quickly becomes an average IPA. "
"Heady Topper","Hands down the best beer I've ever had. I heard all the hype and went down to the brewery to try it myself. I left with 3 cases and a new favorite beer. "
"Heady Topper","So many flavors. Drank out of a snifter poured fresh from the can. A variety of hops throughout although not too much (I am no ""hophead""). Delicious malt. Cannot recommend enough. Lives up to the hype if you can get your hands on a can. Glad I live in Vermont."
"Heady Topper","Can sent in a trade - 2 weeks old. "
"Heady Topper","This is an absolutely incredible beer. I am a huge fan of Double IPAs, so I try them all and this is the best one I have had to date. It has such a refreshing taste and it packs a punch. I wish it wasn’t so hard to find, but I know that adds to the mystique. For all you beer fans out there, you will find it in Burlington along with many other good beers. I usually can argue top 250 ratings, but this one has the right top dog."
"Heady Topper","What else can I say. Heady Topper has been one of the few beers out of all that I've tried that really lives up to the hype. A masterpiece by The Alchemist. Beer looks great and tastes great whether out of the can or poured. Appearance is copper, orange, unfiltered, cloudy, danky looking. Smell is spot on hoppy, piney, danky and citrusy. Taste is incredible with lots of pungent grapefruit in your face balanced by the piney bitterness and malt. Keeps you wishing you had a whole case. Mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly carbonated. It goes down so easy. This beer is #1 for a reason."
"Heady Topper","Not being an ipa fan this beer is awesome. The hops are so well balanced. Highly revcommend dor the non ipa lover. I bought a 4 pk and can kick myself for not getting a case . Next visit I will get at least 1 case! A definite option for the non IPA oriented consumer."
"Heady Topper","Received two 4-packs in a trade with bostonbeans originating on the other site. Purchased a week ago, so this beer is fresh to deff... Whatever that means. First time drinking, and I'm pretty excited. Thanks, Vini!"
"Heady Topper","Drinking this beauty on a lazy Saturday afternoon and figured I should have reviewed this a long time ago."
"Heady Topper","So the age old debate.... Heady vs Pliny..."
"Heady Topper","This is my 2nd time having this, and it shocked me both times."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 ounce can into a Spiegelau tulip - no, I didn't follow the rules and drink it out of the can. No freshness date printed on the can."
"Heady Topper","Finally got my hands on some of this, first off let me say this beer is awesome. The second you open the can you are hit with an explosion of hops."
"Heady Topper","I must say this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Not only does it taste flawless but it looks and smells flawless as well. One of the most difficult beers to purchase on the market! Well worth the wait though. The smell alone if like no other, very fruity and strong, but not over powering."
"Heady Topper","A - The beer is golden yellowish with a sticky white head. good lace in glass but its best served drank from can because it dosnt look that good."
"Heady Topper","They hype was not false. This was absolutely divine!"
"Heady Topper","Definitely worthy of a 100 rating. Fresh hop beer consumed very soon after shipment arrived. Dank, grassy hops. Slight spice and earthy tones. Perfect carbonation and a sweet, faint malt character. Still trumped by Pliny and Enjoy By but among the top of its class. Oh, and I was a bad boy and didn't drink from the can. Hats off to the Alchemest all the way from Vermont doing the west coast ipa as good as or better than almost anyone out there."
"Heady Topper","Can that traveled from Vermont to Washington to Maine."
"Heady Topper","Another head sucked into the hype. After trying the sample from the Alchemist tap, which was damn delicious, I was still unsure if the journey was worth it. Settled back where I was staying, I cracked a can and fell in love."
"Heady Topper","When it's fresh it's truly amazing. Liquid hop candy. Sweet but not cloying with with notes of resin, pine and grapefruit. Like drinking a liquid forest. As it ages it loses it's sweetness and grassy notes begin to dominate."
"Heady Topper","From the first crack of the can the piney hops aromas are enough to make you think you are amongst the pine covered hills of Vermont. The can does not lie - your first sip will be an explosion of hops. This beer is not for the faint of heart, but if you are a hop head beware... this DIPA could quite possibly ruin all others for you. :)"
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can into a tulip glass..."
"Heady Topper","Made the 7 hour round trip to acquire this wonderful beer. "
"Heady Topper","Let me preface this by saying, I'm not much of an IPA hop head. But a buddy scored this and I had to try it out of the can followed by in a glass. I actually like the glass offering better, but here goes: Poured from can into DFH snifter. Great looking light pale yellow beer with an inviting 2 fingers of head. Straw hues and a bit of cloudiness. Smell is awesome. Citrus hops meet earthy/pine hops. Getting grapefruit and apricot on the nose. Taste was pretty balanced and smooth for such a strong announced IBU. For not a big fan of the style, I was glad it went down as easy as it did. More pronounced fruit as it warmed. The can offering just seemed a bit less flavorful? to me than the glass. Feel was great with a medium heft and carbonation that was pleasant. Overall: The best IPA I have had, but again it's not my wheelhouse. I liked the citrus frontend and balance. I can see where those who love the style would really like this. I would drink again and think it's a must try."
"Heady Topper","Appearance is a can, I followed the instructions and I'm glad I did."
"Heady Topper","Without a doubt this is my favorite beer. Although the instructions on the can say to drink from the can I have on occaision used a glass, which is my prefferred beer drinking method. When you first open one you are hit with a wonderful smell that is not matched by any other beer I have ever experienced. The flavor of this awesom double IPA is very hoppy yet slightly fruity at the same time. There is something else unique about the tast but I cannot put it into words. I guess I find it robust and strong but smooth at the same time. The limited avaiablity undoubtedly adds to the mystic of this beer. I usually only get to have some about twice a year. Whenever I drink other IPAs I always mentally compare them to Heady Topper and they alwasy fall short, even if they are very good. For me nothing tops Heady Topper!"
"Heady Topper","I suggest getting multiples to try one from the can, one in glass. Although most of everything you can say about this beer has been said, my take way is hugely balanced beer with great hops to malt balance, up front citrus fades to pine then to a roasty malt."
"Heady Topper","The beer pours a pumpkin hued orange that is very cloudy. Ecru colored head is well maintained with thick gobs of sticky lacing left with each sip. The scent is overwhelmingly hoppy and seems to span the entire hop spectrum without becoming muddled. Notes of pineapple, pine, orange citrus, pear and some background general scent of yeast. Very heady experience. "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper "
"Heady Topper","A friend gave this to me out of nowhere, he said it was canned within the week. "
"Heady Topper","When a beer reaches the lofty heights of a Heady Topper it feels almost unfair to pen a review. After all, how could I possibly review it based solely on it's merits and deficiencies? Most everyone will either praise it's strengths whilst ignoring the faults or harp on flaws and turn a blind eye toward the many amazing things this drink does so superbly. "
"Heady Topper","Very nice IPA. Fresh nose, with tons of citrus. The mouth feel has kind of a oil texture to it. This really is one of the best out there. I have been told that it is not as good if not fresh. I would actually like to try one a couple months old to taste the difference."
"Heady Topper","A great hop beer with a smooth finish. The best micro brew I have had yet. "
"Heady Topper","I'll start by saying I am first and foremost a Belgian fan but wanted to try heady simply because it was number 1. Definitely one of the best IPAs I have ever had, beating out sculpin and stones enjoy by... The bitterness is non existent and you get swept by the grapefruit and pine flavors immediately. And even after settling a bit, the typical dry ipa bitterness never arrives. A must for every beer fan but with the understanding that there is a hype factor. Once again...I could think of many more Belgians I would prefer."
"Heady Topper","Had side by side with Surly Abrasive and Pliny. By far finished last! Sorry, good for an east coast IPA, but no match for west coast. Pours a cloudy opaque orange color, odd chalky mouthfeel, and a little thick for the style. Prefer a cleaner, crisper, more bitter, hop forward IPA. I see why they want you to drink from the can, not a good looking beer at all! Taste not too far off. Not even in my top ten. Sorry."
"Heady Topper","What can I say? This beer is the reason I joined BA today. Turned on by a friend, i am eager to begin trading for this and other great beers. Heady Topper embodies everything I look for in an IPA. Seriously, this beer has it all. Great aroma, piney, tropical fruit flavored goodness. There is an excellent balance to this machine. Kudos to all at The Alchemist, you have earned my business if you can ever get down to Atlanta!"
"Heady Topper","First time having this beer thanks to a trade. Soon as i took my first sip i got a blast of hops on the tongue. Hints of pine and grapefruit come through. This is simply one of the best if not the best DIPA out there. Zombie dust is a close second for me. cheers!"
"Heady Topper","This beer deserves to be at the top of the charts. An incredible refreshing double IPA. As soon as you crack the can open you are delighted with a burst of great smell, taste and hops. Citrus smell and flavor comes through well. The fact it taste so good out of can gets a big thumbs up."
"Heady Topper","This is a useless review, I'm no critic but I love heady topper. Got a case the last canning day at their current location. No refined palate here, but I appreciate great beer and I consider ht a leader of the pack. I love the can, I prefer drinking out of a can across the board, and I am no stranger to Budweiser or miller lite. To me all these beers have a place, but as far as double IPA's go, this is my favorite so far."
"Heady Topper","Firts time i stop at the alchemist (driving from Ottawa Canada to Cape-Cod) they were out... i was mad. On the way home...they were still out of beer. I was really mad. The free samples were nice...but its more like torture."
"Heady Topper","Stopped by the brewery as part of a tour around New England, having an onsite sample and picking up a case of cans."
"Heady Topper","OK we made the pilgrimage from the Capital District in NY to Vermont. The Alchemist will not be open to the public past 11/15/13 while they look for another place to open up. Yep it was worth the trip."
"Heady Topper","The OG of the DIPA world. Had 1 from the can and 1 from a glass."
"Heady Topper","Poured a hazy bronze hue with a two finger frothy white head. There was excellent retention and excellent lacing. "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper from The Alchemist is the counter-point to Pliny the Elder. It's brash, fun, and overpowering. This is not a subtle beer. Truth be told, I'm not sure I've had enough of it to rate it."
"Heady Topper","Acquired in a trade from member on HBT Forum."
"Heady Topper","This review is based on a couple Headys I've have over the last week (following a great trip with the girl up to northern Vermont). Drank one from the can, another from a snifter."
"Heady Topper","The legendary Heady Topper! I was able to get my hands on this quite a few times at a local bar that was selling them in NYC. After having Pliny I was most definitely curious to see how heady ranked next to it. So...."
"Heady Topper","Served from the can approximately one week after the canning date. The beer was kept cold from the initial purchase. The smell when you first crack the can is one of the best smells I've experienced while enjoying beers. The perfect balance of hops hits your palate with perfect balance. When poured from the can, the color is slightly hazy and beautiful. Overall one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of having."
"Heady Topper","I retried this beer this past weekend at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. Drank straight from the can. I still consider it the king of DIPA's. How this beer is so crushable yet 8% ABV is beyond me. Time always makes me forget. I'll try a Trillium or a Tree House here and there and think, is Heady really still #1? Every time I retry it I re-affirm ""yes. Yes it is."""
"Heady Topper","Christmas Heady muled down from Vermont by my sister in law.  Broke rule number one and poured it into a glass.  Outstanding looking beer, not that clear watery look that many have, looks full and rich, orangish color, impressive head that stuck around and lacing was ideal.  I know I am supposed to drink it from the can but it is a great looking beer.  The smell is unreal, the citrus really jumps out at you.  The flavor follows and is also incredible, the juicy citrus jumps out at you, real smooth except for the bitter.  May be just a bit to much for me (not a hop head).  Plus, the bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue.  Rich, full texture with great carbonation, the perfect amount.  I did not notice any alcohol, it was an extremely easy to drink beer with the exception of the lingering bitterness.  Not the top for me but I completely understand why the hop heads love it."
"Heady Topper","Tasted On: 11-01-2013"
"Heady Topper","Wow. An outstanding beer. This really lived up to the hype (which is really saying something). I felt like I could truly taste the varietals of hops and it was magnificent. I am sold on this beer. One of the best I've had. My favorite part about this is that it says in the can to drink this straight from the can! This place is progressive and has fully embraced the superioriority of the can to the bottle."
"Heady Topper","This is a great beer to pick apart."
"Heady Topper","Appearance - They say to drink it from the can, so that's what I did. Living fairly close by (in NH) I've had more than my fair share of Heady, and a few times I've shared it with friends that have poured it out. I've not seen the extreme cloudiness on these occasions, but you can definitely tell it is unfiltered."
"Heady Topper","Many thanks to shawnp for hooking me up with this one."
"Heady Topper","I FINALLY went to Vermont and I got the Heady Topper! I felt like a little kid once it was in my hands. This beer is the best thing since slice bread.. If you haven't had the Heady Topper find a way to get this beer in your hands...I went on Saturday October 26. They were sold out of the cans.. The lady who was handing out the samples told me on Monday they will have more for sale.. Once I walked in to the brewery on that Monday... Wowww!! You can smell the hops once you walk in.. The machines were cranking! Bottles we're being filled and my smile grew. I bought myself two 4 packs.. I'm happy with what I bought BUT something is telling me I'm going to have to drive from Boston back to VT - this time I'm grabbing a case."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is at the top of most DIPA lovers lists or beer aficionados lists and for good reason. "
"Heady Topper","A regular at Max's brought in a can each day of Max's Hopfest (from notes, 8/16-18/13)"
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Mysterious. No, I’m not trying to be cheesy. We drank it straight from the can, as suggested. Could see a little bit of golden liquid on the rim of the can as I drank it."
"Heady Topper","Absolute perfection in a can. Strong grapefruit aroma, and taste does not deviate from the scent. Mouthful loaded with grapefruit and sweet hop goodness, with a smooth finish. Beer actually gets better with each passing sip and is extremely drinkable. Straight from the can is the way to go as instructed ."
"Heady Topper","Trade from A generous trader. Thanks man!!!! Can poured to tulip so I can see it. Some sediment. This isn't super pretty, but the beautiful creaminess of the head brings the appearance up a bit, otherwise not a good look. Will go from can next time. Pours a hazy light golden copper color with just under one finger head. Big floral pineapple and grapefruit aromas, sweetness, mango. Yum. Flavor is heavier on the bitter pine up front, some earthy dirt (in a good way), with some beautiful tropical fruit lingering on the palate, and a pretty dry finish. Almost a creamy feel as I get through this. This highlights the tropical hops for sure. Slick mouthfeel but plenty of carbonation to lighten things up. Is this am excellent DIPA? Yes. Did it live up to the hype for me? Probably not. But very nice in a very different way from some other in the style. Would still likely go for Dreadnaught, Hopslam, Pliny, and Enjoy By before this one. But that's pretty good company. I will revisit tomorrow with a fresh palate to make sure, and try out of a can."
"Heady Topper","Served on tap in a Tulip Glass at the brewery as a sample."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip glass, Taste rated from the can"
"Heady Topper","Canned early october. About 2 weeks old. I have had this numerous times, but thought i'd give it a proper review, fresh, at proper temperature. "
"Heady Topper","One of the most amazing beers I have ever experienced. From the pour it looks great, a carmel brown. The smell is crisp hopps, the taste starts in one place and ends in another ( to me a sharp grapefruity finish), that leaves you ready to open the next one because the first one is gone! One of the best beers I have ever tasted."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Johnmichaelson and Kurmaraja! 2 cans of Heady in one week! I prefer the glass, and the brewery wants you to drink straight from the can. What do you do? Have them side-by-side! This will be a combined review from a straight pint glass, and the 16oz can, switching between sips as I watched the Talladega NASCAR race."
"Heady Topper","Wow I finally get to try the Topper!"
"Heady Topper","One of the best beers or let alone double ipa i have ever had very resiny sticky mouthfeel, balanced with citrusy piney hop flavors and a nice sweet subtle malt backbone. Very comparable to pliney the elder in taste maybe just a little more heavy and flavorful both really amazing."
"Heady Topper","Theres nothing I can say about this beer that hundreds of people haven't said before. It's that damn good. I've paid $10 a can and I gotta say I'd pay $20. Looking forward to finally making a trip up to Waterbury next year. Pro tip: Makes a great wedding present. Tuck that knowledge away."
"Heady Topper","Here it is folks, the single most overrated beer in drinking history. I've been a beer fanatic for a decade and a half, and the beer drinking world has a lot to answer for on this one. The best beer in the world? What a joke. I wouldn't even put this in the top 10 of IPA's let alone beers of any style. "
"Heady Topper","This beer lives up to the reputation. Had a successful trade that landed me 6 of these beauties and I'm now sans HT. "
"Heady Topper","Can was about 2 months old, thanks brian!"
"Heady Topper","Appearance - Had the luxury of having this on tap while visiting my hometown of Middlebury VT but I will review the can considering everyone is drinking this from a can. Appearance from pouring from a can, you will quickly notice that this brew is unfiltered, sentiment at the bottom, slight bubble carbonation, pours a nice murky orange color with a two finger head that slowly will disappear. The color is enough to tell you this is unfiltered."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to my neighbors Nate and Erika for bringing this back for me. This is a Holy Grail beer that I have wanted to try for a long time now. "
"Heady Topper","This is the nectar of the Gods! Wow!"
"Heady Topper","Look: Hazy opaque pale gold with a thick white head. Moderate activity and subtle lacing. "
"Heady Topper","Fairly fresh, received in a trade. Should be less than 2 weeks old. I poured a little bit into a taster just to see appearance, the rest of the review will be from the can, as the brewer intended. "
"Heady Topper","Drank it from the can as advised (6 days old) and also poured into pint glass. Lived up to the hype. Lugged some back to CA, drank it side-by-side with Pliny. In that pantheon. Loved visiting the brewery in Waterbury -- simply evil that it is essentially next door to Ben and Jerry's. Evil."
"Heady Topper",A:
"Heady Topper","Poured from a pint can to a poco grande style glass; just enough to look at the body, drank the rest straight from the can. Hey it's right on the can to enjoy it that way!"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to jbaker67 for the can! Poured at fridge temp into a Tallgrass Brewing cervoise glass. "
"Heady Topper","Finally got my hands on this guy. A bit poured into a pint glass, rest enjoyed out of the can. "
"Heady Topper","Does HT really need another review saying how equally good and unattainable it is? Well I thought so, so here it is."
"Heady Topper","I can honestly say I bought at least 10 cases of Heady over the past year. Drank more of these than any other beer over the past 12 months. Love driving up from PA to Vermont. And also love sharing this amazing brew with people that never had it. Vermont beercations are amazing!"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can. Did not pour into a glass, so I can not say what it looks like, but the can is very cool. My dad will love this addition to his beer can collection. Bittersweet grapefruit and dank hop resins dominate, I can already tell this drinks like juice. A bit of pineapple and mango are noticeable on the nose as well. On the first sip, I couldn't believe how complex a one dimensional beer could be. This beer really doesn't need a malt backbone, what a use of hops. Drinks so easy from the can."
"Heady Topper","--Update-- thanks to a second from 'dorsch'...this beer is way better out of the can. the green comes out, the dry-hop is more prominent, and it really is a different beer. both good, but like pbr...better in the can."
"Heady Topper","The Alchemist cannery is only 10 miles from my house and I have a case (or so) of this beer in my fridge at any one time... I am incredibly fortunate that it is my ""regular"". I frequented and severely miss the Alchemist Pub & Brewery that was destroyed by the flooding in downtown Waterbury, VT during Hurricane Irene. Heady Topper is a constant reminder of what a great brewery my good friends John and Jen Kimmich run. I hope that this beer remains BeerAdvocate's #1 beer ""forever""... :)"
"Heady Topper","Consumed October 4th, 2013 from an undated can. Poured into a Samuel Adams ""perfect pint"" glass."
"Heady Topper","First of all, I want to say that I am excited about finally tasting this beer. It has been on my hit-list for a year and, my stars, I was gifted a can this afternoon by a co-worker (danke schön, Mike). The only potential downside is that it was canned in June, it's October, and I have been cautioned by both John Kimmich and devotees to drink it immediately after canning. Any subsequent lapses in enthusiasm are likely owing to this shortcoming. "
"Heady Topper","I just made my monthly trip to The Alchemist and figured it is finally time to write a review."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: golden yellow with small white head (only poured a little bit into a glass)"
"Heady Topper","Canned only 3 days ago (!), this was an incredibly generous trade surprise from mtomlins and a beer I've been hoping to try for ages. It is just plain stunning and actually lives up to my (unduly high) expectations..."
"Heady Topper","Cracking open a fresh Heady..."
"Heady Topper","Received this can from my good friend DWitt. Good looking out, even though u r a g damn Sander. "
"Heady Topper","Picked this baby up from a great friend at the Borefts Bier Fest! It's a little over a week since it was canned so it's super fresh. Cloudy amber-orange pour with a huge 2+ finger fluffy white head with decent retention and lacing. Fresh, dank, resiny hops totally dominate the nose along with some great perfumey, floral and citrus notes. This is one of those really special smelling beers that you'll always remember. The taste is just as big and bold. It starts off like the nose as a total fresh hop monster, full of resiny pine and bitter grapefruit along with some nice tropical notes. About midway through there's a measure of balance as some of the caramel malt sweetness emerges along with some orange peel, tangerine, and a bit of grassiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and oddly creamy for an IPA. Surprisingly balanced and incredibly drinkable for such a big, hoppy beer. Overall, not sure it lived up to all the hype, but still one hell of a beer!"
"Heady Topper","What else really needs to be said? Had a taste from the tap but reviewing based on 1 pint cans.Both are my first experiences with Heady. It's perfect. Beautiful pale hazy yellow when poured, which I did with 1 of 4 cans I've had so far. Delicious, smooth and flavor-filled. Hits all the right notes. Little floral, little citrus and a little pine lumped together into a spectacular punch of flavor. Spent 10 hrs in a car to bring this home and it was worth every second."
"Heady Topper","Murky golden orange color with a fat layer of off-white foam on the surface. Deep, dank, fresh bag-o-hops smell...spicy, resinous pine, pungent, juicy citrus, and peaches. An almost toffee-ish malt profile lurks underneath. Huge hoppy flavor (obviously): fresh floral hop cones, grapefruit, pine needles, stone fruit, maybe some tropical fruit. Seems kind of like a lot of Simcoe to me. Dry, smooth,and textured. Bitter, but nothing crazy. This is a great, supremely hopped-up DIPA that manages to stay really drinkable. A bit too hyped up, but undeniably impressive."
"Heady Topper","Religious experience. I went to the brewery on a Saturday, opens at 11am, and by that time there were, 40 people behind me, from all over the continent!"
"Heady Topper","Absolutely love this beer. Just had it for the first time in Vermont. I'm used to Belgians for this high of alcohol contents. Absolutely love the flowery smell."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. "
"Heady Topper","To date, one of the most enjoyable beers that I've ever drank."
"Heady Topper","This is everything a beer should be amazing drinkability great odor and taste this is just everything that I could possibly want in a beer experience. The presentation of the can is perfect and well worth the journey into the middle of no where Vermont. While 72 for a case may seem high I would be willing to spend over and over again."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Nice hazy orange color. Very nice off-white head."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: It has a nice hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves lovely lacing."
"Heady Topper","First time having this brew. I must say it lived up to the hype for sure. great hoppy taste and not too bitter. very easily drinkable. I would choose this over any other ipa/dipa available. the only negative thing I can say about it is it's availability. I wish I didn't have to have it shipped out to Las Vegas! Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Was everything I hoped it to be. Thank you Danny Mac for sharing! I wish I had just one more sip, then one more can. Everyone can write more descriptive reviews, I just wanted to tell about the experience. Read a ton of opinions and this was one of the few that I whole heartedly agree with. If you have it, I am jealous, if you can find it, count yer blessings! If you have an extra share it with a friend. Drink, be fat and happy all!"
"Heady Topper","It's heady topper... everyone wants a piece of it. Here in burlington, people still stand in line for it and it sells out quite quickly when it hits the shelf. "
"Heady Topper","A- Pours a medium bright orange golden color. Not quite brilliant, but far from dull in color. Big, frothy head that retains and laces tremendously. Hazy and beautiful in the glass."
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can. Aroma is very strong, lots of floral hops. Pours a nice golden color and white head. Taste is very strong hops that take over the more you sip it. It is one of the cloudiest beers I have ever seen. You can taste the resin right away and it is not a bad thing! This is my favorite DIPA to date."
"Heady Topper","A can traded to me by a fellow BA. What a nice gesture! A 16 oz can of the top rated beer and they tell you to drink it from the can."
"Heady Topper","Special thanks to Jake Holland for providing this delicious beverage..."
"Heady Topper","I really don't feel the is anything I ""can"" add to this wonderful beer the only reason it feel short of perfect is because I can't drink any other beer with it, nothing before and nothing after. If I drink something before I simply don't enjoy heady as much and if I drink something after I lose the desire for beer. Other then that it is wonderful, But I have to session it by itself have 2 or 3 and call it a night."
"Heady Topper","Appearance- Pours up a more than a fair amount of head and seems to have pretty good retention. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a hazy, pale to medium amber with weak grapefruit notes which glows a pale amber with hints of orange when held up to the light. Hazy but I haven't detected any of the infamous floaters. Some lacing is left behind. "
"Heady Topper","Cracked a can which was about 2 months old. Poured into a tulip glass."
"Heady Topper","16oz can, thanks to Phyl21ca for getting this across the continent to me. If we are entreated to ""Drink from the Can!"", then why does the label illustration show the dude getting his mind literally blown ('heady topped?'), using a GLASS?"
"Heady Topper","This was one of the great Craft Beer experiences that I've tasted. And after what my Mother-In-law went through to get it for me I had great expectations. And I wasn't disappointed. Great taste and finish. A beer that I could drink every day, if I could get enough."
"Heady Topper","Lightly chilled 16 oz. can. Picked up last Wendesday outside Burlington, VT. Poured a couple oz. into a shaker to get a look at it, the rest stayed in the can as per the brewer's printed plea."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: golden yellow with orange hues, white fizzy head, very hazy"
"Heady Topper","I love this beer a lot and appreciate the fact that such a good beer is made in my home state, It will get you twisted pretty quick because to me I couldn't really taste the alcohol but instead the delicious floral hops. When I was at Nectar's bar, everyone had a Heady Topper!"
"Heady Topper","Appearance was cloudy and golden with a coppery-orange hue; moderate, bone-colored, head retention."
"Heady Topper","Original review 9/8/13:"
"Heady Topper","Had this beer many times, but I still pour into a glass even though Alchemist says not too."
"Heady Topper","General - I was in Albany, NY for the holiday weekend and made my friend drive 4 hours north to VT to get me a case of this before I even arrived. I've had extremely high expectations for this beer since reading all the reviews and never getting to try it. I drank it out of the can, just like the can says to do!"
"Heady Topper","A: Hazy, orange body. Small fizzy bubbles. Moderate retention."
"Heady Topper","I poured just a little bit into a glass, to see the color. It says to drink it from the can. It has a light burnt orange color it. The aroma is strong piney hops. The taste is a little bitter than the citrus comes in. At the end the hops bite your tongue like a rattlesnake. It leaves a bitter after taste and overall one hell of a beer."
"Heady Topper","I have this beer a lot as well as other IPAs out there and it still holds its rank as #1 in my book."
"Heady Topper","A - Yellow-orange and hazy. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?"
"Heady Topper","Thanks, Kristen."
"Heady Topper","From the can distributed during the week of August 26, 2013. Sampled on September 1, 2013."
"Heady Topper","16oz tallboy, purchased cans from the brewery."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to Phyl21ca for sending a 4 pack of these out together with some other awesome beers in a great trade. Review #200 - and some amazing beers left to try!"
"Heady Topper","Big shout out to my fellow Beer Advocate Mikeypnh for the hookup on this one"
"Heady Topper","In short, lives up to the hype for sure. "
"Heady Topper","Tasted it for the first time yesterday in the studios of VPT in Colchester, VT: MAMMAMIA! That thing knocked me off my socks! "
"Heady Topper","Tasted on 11/11/11 from a can shared by ryan585, thanks Ryan. Pours murky orange with a very thin white head that leaves a thin collar of lace, with some chunky sediment. The nose is intense orange peel citrus, resin bitterness, chewable kids vitamins, caramel malt, and a touch of earthy yeast. The flavor is orange and grapefruit peel, bitter resin, chewable kids vitamins, the same earthy yeast, and just enough caramel malt to keep everything in balance. The body is medium with an oily texture, lighter than average carbonation, and a very long resin and citrus peel bitter finish."
"Heady Topper","Can @ Dan’s house, courtesy of doodler. Huge thanks! Cloudy, yellow orange appearance with an orange tinged off white head. Slightly resiny, piney, organic hoppy, citrusy aroma. Very nice, piney, somewhat resiny, hoppy, tasty citrusy flavor. Awesome! "
"Heady Topper","Had this (along with other dipa's) at a East VS. West Dipa Head to Head Showdown I hosted on 8/27/13"
"Heady Topper","I absolutely love this beer. The first time I had it I wasn't overly impressed. Since then it has grown on me and I love it. I had been shying away from IPA's and there were few DIPA's I really enjoyed. Since having Heady several times over the last month I keep drinking more and more DIPA's only to be disappointed that it doesn't live up to Heady. Some may match it in 1 or 2 area's but I don't think there is an IPA or any style I would rather drink than Heady."
"Heady Topper","This beer is amazing and quite unlike most other beers I've had, even DIPA's."
"Heady Topper","My first shot at HT and I have to say, it wasn't what I expected. I was expecting a hop bomb being a dipa at 8% abv but it wasn't. Definitely the most well balanced ipa/dipa I have ever had. Taste and mouth feel were definitely great (alcohol was very well hidden). Appearance and smell were very good but not the best. Overall it was an awesome beer and I can't wait to have it again!"
"Heady Topper","I often mention how my opinion of a beer can affected even before I drink it because of what I have heard about it before hand. Heady Topper is definitely one that fits into the category. Being the highest ranked beer on this site, this brew was pretty hyped up in my head before hand. I am happy to say it didn't disappoint but I don't think it is quite worthy of being ranked as high as it is."
"Heady Topper","Poured out of the can (you don't own me Jon kimmich) into an HT stemless glass. Pours cloudy, a few floaters, nice orange color. To me this beer has the perfect smell. So floral and citrusy. I go to the cannery if I'm in VT, even if they are out, mostly because of the aroma there. Taste is outstanding. So citrusy, with a very complementing bitterness. This beer is worth the 7 hour round trip i take just for a couple cases. There's a reason it's #1."
"Heady Topper","I finally got my hands on this beer from a beer distributor on Long Island...and it was worth the money i spent on it...never took it out of the can as per the instructions on the can, so i couldn't even tell u what it looks like lol...the smell jumps out of the can and smacks u in the face, very orangey citrus and piney on the nose...the taste is legendary, like its reputation..for me the high carbonation carried the piney hop hues to the back of the mouth and completely distracts u of any alcohol that a high alcohol brew might be characteristic of...therefore it is ridiculously drinkable...one of the better beers u will try as advertised "
"Heady Topper","Finally able to try this, thank you lucas1801. Pours a hazy golden orange color. Smells is heavy citrus, orange and tangerine. Taste is very citrusy kinda like the citrus notes in Jai Alai, not overly hoppy. Overall this beer is worth seeking out and unlike any other IPA I have had."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a snifter. "
"Heady Topper","So here it is. Never thought I'd get a chance to try it, or if I did I'd have to pay a ton to get it, which I wouldn't at this point, so I guess this makes this a rare and valued occasion, for which I am indeed grateful. "
"Heady Topper","Finally trying the famous Heady Topper, thanks to an awesome gift from Ljudsignal!"
"Heady Topper","Had at the Skinny Pancake at Burlington Airport"
"Heady Topper","I have driven 3 and half hours just to get this beer. That's saying enough about how awesome it is. I just can't get enough of it!"
"Heady Topper","First off, thanks to mshull for trading this to me! My first Heady on my 31st birthday"
"Heady Topper","Poured a 5 oz. taster just to see the color."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Thanks to Ben Warner for this unexpected treat."
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can, poured just a sip or two to see what it looks like."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can picked up from the Alchemist cannery in Waterbury, VT. Drank from both the can, as instructed, and a New Belgium snifter."
"Heady Topper","Drinking straight from the can...will try pouring on the next one."
"Heady Topper","This is my SH*T! I consume at least 2 per week. Luckily I live in Northern NY and can take the Ferry across the Lake to Vermont to get my hands on this beloved brew! YUM YUM YUM!! Although I have not actually been to the Alchemist them selves, I can get it at beverage depots and bars in Burlington VT."
"Heady Topper","Simply sublime all around."
"Heady Topper",Appearance:
"Heady Topper","Had a sampling of it at my local World of Beer with the owners who received it from a patron"
"Heady Topper","Shared with a selfless coworker who held on to the can until we could share it."
"Heady Topper","poured/drank from a 16 oz can (poured a bit in goblet to test the contrast)"
"Heady Topper","I live in South Florida (not a place well known for it's beer) so I had to look northward to the second least populated state in the USA for great beer. I was begging my relatives, clients, Ebay posters and friends to find a way to get me a try since I saw that Heady was the world's top rated beer on Beer Advocate. Finally, one of my friends came thru and told me my prayers had been answered and a case was on its way last week. After inspecting the case to make sure all cans were on hand and in great shape I began my personal journey. I have now concluded that Heady Topper is far and away the finest quality beer made, should be deemed a national treasure and is the best tasting Imperial IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. As smooth as a great brew could be with hints of grapefruit,1st rate hops, blood orange citrus, delicate cream and subtle pine. I am truly fortunate to be able to share my case of Heady with my beer friends and hope you are able to find a way to get a few cans to savor yourself. Please let me know when you have finished your first can, if you feel the way I do send me a personal note. Cheers to all!"
"Heady Topper","The best IPA I have ever had! I mouthful of hops and a dry bitterness that stays in your taste buds minutes after each sip. "
"Heady Topper","Can "
"Heady Topper","made the haul up there t0o northern VT got there at 10:30 on a Monday line was around the building"
"Heady Topper","Re-reviewing this beer... "
"Heady Topper","Can. Hazy, yellow/straw liquid small to medium white/light off-white head. Aroma of fresh hops, grapefruit, citrus, cereal malt, lemon grass, orange peel, tangerines and blackberries. Awesome. Taste is dry and medium to high bitter with lots of fresh, hoppy notes of grass, grapefruit and tangerine. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Very well brewed DIPA. Love the fresh hoppy notes."
"Heady Topper","Drank from can as recommended and from tulip glass. Preferred the tulip glass as way more aroma was present. "
"Heady Topper","A little old, about a month, I bough two four packs on my way through VT when I went to vacation in upstate New York, so my ratings will be heavily weighted on my original impressions. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks, Cliff, for procuring me this highly sought-after brew. "
"Heady Topper","There's not much to say about this beer that already hasn't been said. It just doesn't get any better."
"Heady Topper","Headed up to Stowe VT next week and plan on buying plenty!"
"Heady Topper","I wasn't sure if this beer could live up to all the hype..."
"Heady Topper","6/17/12. Tallboy shared by a dude in the BA Zhukov line. Nice pour - orange with a nice khaki head.. Wonderful hoppy aroma with lots of citrus and grapefruit, some malt backing. Nice hoppy flavor with plenty of sweet caramel backing up the bold citrus and grapefruit. Nice!"
"Heady Topper","Drink it out of the CAN!!! First of all; dont tell me how to drink my beer... "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Liam for hooking up a few cans of this bad boy"
"Heady Topper","A - cloudy with chunks, yellowish-red in color. "
"Heady Topper","2 month old can, poured into a glass.  Hazy and golden in color.  Huge pine and citrus on the nose.  Taste: pine, citrus, some floral notes, and a slight cracker-y sweetness from the malt.  Huge body for an IPA.  The bitterness explodes on your tongue, yet doesn't linger.  Finishes dry.  Somehow easy to drink despite the hugeness."
"Heady Topper","Hops, Hops, and more Hops. Bright gold, with an orange tint appearance. As can instructs, you have to drink it out of the can, and in turn reminds me of college beer nights while tasting much better. Extremely hoppy to the first taste, smooth but also foamy in your mouth, and finishes with a less bitter than expected after taste. Spoiled rotten to work in Montpelier where almost all significant restaurants carry Heady Topper now. Simply no debate, it is No. 1 for a reason. MUST TRY!!!"
"Heady Topper","I went to the beer shop in Waterbury and tried this beer. There is a reason this beer is rated as the best beer in America. It is the best beer I have ever had. It had a great taste. I wish everyone could try this beer. I wanted to buy a case but the were sold out."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into a brew fest tasting glass that holds 4 oz. The rest was consumed out of the can."
"Heady Topper","Fresh beer, and one of the best of its kind. The one thing that I always look for is balance. This beer has beautiful balance! Is this the number one beer that I've ever had? I would have to disagree with it being ranked number one, but I would definitely drink again, and would rank in the top 20 of the ones that I've tried."
"Heady Topper","For the love of all that is holy!!! "
"Heady Topper","Thanks so much to Tom for this beautiful can of elusive goodness from vermont. "
"Heady Topper","On my visit to Chicago, I stopped by Beer Temple with my companion and got an opportunity to meet the famed Christopher Quinn. As we approached the counter to inquire about any rare beers in his store a silver can caught our eye. Needless to say what luck to have walked in on this tasting. "
"Heady Topper","16oz can; half poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass, half drank from the can"
"Heady Topper","I was so happy to finally taste this 'mythical' beer that seems so hard to find. My uncle brought down 6 from Vermont and we compared side by side with Pliny the Elder. I decided to split the experience, half in a dog fish head tulip and the other half out of the can. "
"Heady Topper","Lucky for me, a co-worker brought me a case back from vacation. "
"Heady Topper","Pours a golden amber with a two-finger off-white head. No ""floaties"" that many reviewers speak of. Nice lacing. A complex and unique aroma. Redolent of pine, tropical fruit, citrus, and earthiness; the kind of earthiness you experience walking through the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert (for those old enough to remember the Dead). As it warms, there's a wonderfully faint floral aroma. Through all those hops one can still get a whiff of the sweet malt! Incredibly complex. The taste is very juicy, more fruit than pine. Tropical fruit hits the tongue first followed by citrus, mainly grapefruit, and dried apricot. Lots of caramel and biscuity malt flavors balance this hop bomb perfectly. Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a top two or three DIPA that is truly worth all the hype (and the aggravation to get it)!"
"Heady Topper","A - Two-finger white head, leaves nice lacing, fairly resilient. Almost a neon yellow-orange pour, settling into the thickest, most opaque IPA I've ever seen.*"
"Heady Topper","Appearance: (4.0) Poured from a can into a pint glass. Hazy, straw yellow color, with a one inch head that dissipates fairly quickly."
"Heady Topper","Got in a trade thanks to Circlenine, cheers! "
"Heady Topper","No real appearance, since I took the suggestion and drank directly from the can. However, I popped the top, and it immediately smelled like I was in the middle of Shenandoah Valley. One of my favorite places to go hiking/camping with my dad. Heady is clean, slightly piney, sweetly floral, and rather bright in aroma. The taste is really light for the 8% ABV. A great hop presence on the tongue, and sweet/bitter combination from the malt/hops. Surprisingly, the piney-ness of the hops isn’t bothering me. I typically don’t like that in my IPAs, and tend to stick towards brighter/more tropical offerings. Short duration on the tongue, which is making me drink this beer faster than I normally would have. My first HT thanks to a trade from lhteacher"
"Heady Topper","Had on-tap and in can numerous times during East Coast trip in May/June. This review is for the canned version."
"Heady Topper","Review 17JUL13"
"Heady Topper","First of all thank you to Tammy in Barre, Vermont for saving my homie that was in Massachusetts 4 packs of this special brew. If you're reading this [ever] you've got a place to drink here in Texas. "
"Heady Topper","I had this recently out of two cans, unfortunately one was absolutely flat with no carbonation. The beer in general has a lovely little bubbled good amount of carbonation. It is actually one of the highlights of this mindblowing beer."
"Heady Topper","Drank this out of the can as the can directs the drink er to do."
"Heady Topper","What else can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? Very few beers actually live up to the hype - Heady Topper does. Im not one to stand in line for hours to get a case of beer but the stores around here serve me well enough. One of the finest beers in the world with out a doubt."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can gifted from a friend, unclear bottling date but about three weeks old (one week old when gifted at NHC2013), poured into my FFF Teku glass, drank 7/14/13 over an hour."
"Heady Topper","I am giving this review for both the can and on tap. I was able to go through Waterbury for a vacation through Vermont. "
"Heady Topper","I just came back from a 3 day mini vacation from Vermont, I talked my wife into going to see this ""beautiful state"" we dragged our 16 year old boy with us, after 1 day in Vermont it was pretty obvious why we were there in the summer.... dad's lust for the ""Holy Grail "" The Alchemist brewery and heady topper.. We stayed at Green mountain inn ( very nice ) and did enjoy the mountain views at smugglers notch, anyway Heady topper was everything I hoped it would be. I was at the hotel's pub when I got my long awaited first can, my wife and son were looking at me like I was nuts, I cracked open the brew and low and behold it was liquid gold. Sorry for the not very scientific review, but it's that good!!"
"Heady Topper","had this tonight for the first time . poured from can at a beer tasting at http://goo.gl/P2J7P .(good time,) one of the 3 best beers i have ever had . very floral aroma. nice bite. clear. clean. hoppy. favorable comparison to Stone Ruination IPA . this is my first review . i felt compelled to write it."
"Heady Topper","Poured from can"
"Heady Topper","Got these via a trade with someone from New Hampshire so I'm not sure how fresh they are. I believe he bought them before he shipped them to me. My first impression was not that great for an IPA. It initially tasted just liked steeped hops. Almost like someone just made tea with a bag of hops. Maybe I was drinking it too cold. My second and third cans seemed much better. Maybe I just had to appreciate it more. I still think there are other better DIPA's out there in my opinion. If you love hops then this is the beer for you as it is all hops and nothing else."
"Heady Topper","A: i poured about 1/3rd of the can into a snifter glass (despite the recomendation to drink from the can) to see the beer I'm drinking (you have to!). It poured with a half finger of bright white head that quickly fell leaving a dusting of tiny bubbles gracefully on the top and a slightly thicker edge around the glass. The beer was a murkey, cloudy pale orange to dark yellow color. Holding it to the light there was a soft glow around the edge, but the center was as dark and murkey as it was without a back light."
"Heady Topper","You simply cannot beat this beer. It looks very cool in the silver can, it tastes amazing, hoppy with low bitterness, it smells gloriously fresh and somewhat citrusy. Smooth. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. It's quite delicious. At first I thought it was over ratted by the time I finished my can, I was converted."
"Heady Topper","Poured with a good bit of head, definitely looks like there is some wheat malt in there. Beer itself is almost an orange color and is completely opaque. If I were to look at this without knowing what it was I would guess it was a hefeweizen. This isn't even a weakish opaqueness, this beer is opaque right up to the edge of the glass!"
"Heady Topper","Pours a two-finger slightly-yellowed clingy head over a cloudy and particulated puke-tan liquid. Smells of green onion and wild garlic (Summit hops) with pine and sharp grapefruit pith. Baby aspirin and lemony tropical fruits. Comes across as a blast of very fresh Summit hops."
"Heady Topper","A: Drank from the can, very nice artwork!"
"Heady Topper","A- poured only half into a glass to experience different flavors from can and glass. golden/orange in color very cloudy, unfiltered. Thick Fluffy white head. "
"Heady Topper","Drove through Waterbury and stopped in. Monday at Noon there was a line out the door to get cases. Tried the beer first while in line. It was good, but nowhere near as dramatic as I was hoping for (Lawson's Double Sunshine has ruined me). Wife gave the green light for 2 cases, but after tasting opted for 1. Opened the first one later in the evening when home. This is the review."
"Heady Topper","I have one person to thank for this mrKennedy what a brilliant unexpected bday present you are the man and I know they say drink out the can but this definitely deserves a glass and pours a cloudy pineapple juice hue with a fluffy cloud like three finger head and lacing everywhere looks so inviting,the smell is pineapples,piney hops,tangerines,grapefruit and a tonne of Valencia oranges,the mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and medium bodied with tastes of pineapples,mangoes,grapefruit,tangerines and finished with a soft citrus bittersweetness and overall what a sublime AIPA it's right up there with the best I've tried and just wish this and the rest of their range was available here cheers."
"Heady Topper","I am a stout lover at heart. I have never taken to the hop head beers out there... well that was until I got my first taste of Heady Topper. It is absolutely deserving of the number one beer on beeradvocate. "
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a hazy orange with a finger of beige head that fades into a thin layer with a little lacing."
"Heady Topper","Okay, so this is my second Heady experience. My first one was during a bottle share with a good friend of mine, and what followed felt magical. I couldn’t believe the flavors I was tasting, and feeling, and comprehending."
"Heady Topper","Canned just over a week ago. For this review I poured it into a snifter, I just need the aroma and carbonation release."
"Heady Topper","Popped the top on the can and was blown away by huge citrus and pine. The smell alone is worth the price of admission. "
"Heady Topper","Was very excited to try this beer and wanted to see if it could live up to the hype. Obeyed what the can said and drank this out of the can, but poured a little out to see the color. It was a golden color with a little cloudiness."
"Heady Topper","First off thanks to my cousin Michael for shipping me a case of incredible North Eastern beers that incorporated a 4-pack of Heady Topper. He is dripping with beer karma indeed."
"Heady Topper","World class ipa not just for the hopheads but in general. Even if you do not like ipas you have to give this a try. It's like biting into a hoppy pineapple without a hint of its true abv. Simply amazing.  Follow directions and do not pour in a glass..."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can pours a cloudy, deep, golden color. About an inch of white head falls quickly to a dusting. (4.0)"
"Heady Topper","Finally. Pours a hazy light orange. Crazy hoppy smell, citrusy. Taste is really nice. Hoppy, but light for the style. Citrusy. Mouthfeel is really nice n creamy. Overall, over rated. Very solid DIPA, top 5 for sure, but over rated. Num 1 in the world, I think not. Not as hoppy as most from 3 floyds. Seek out 3 floyds before you seek this out."
"Heady Topper","How do you approach what some say is the best beer on the planet?"
"Heady Topper","Can. Poured some into a glass to see beer itself. Hazy orange color with a lot of hop particles."
"Heady Topper","Got two cans from MPLSbrewer. Decided to pour one for the review. "
"Heady Topper","We visited The Alchemist's cannery today, and the pair we are cracking for this review were canned today. We will obey the demands from the can and drink straight from the vessel, but we first decant off an ounce or so to assess its appearance. The brew shows a hazy straw coloring, putting up a quick one finger head of lemon meringue colored foam, showing variability of bubble size, and nice retention. Lacing is tight and ridged, snaking the circumference of the glass. Haze is thick, but no outright sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The aroma is pungent, even from the hole in the can, giving fresh pineapple, white grape, apricot tang, fresh earthiness of clayed dirt, raw honey, clover flower, wet moss, cucumber skins, soft plastic bite, and distant farmhouse muskiness. These blend atop a solid base of crisp pale malts and raw barley, powdered sugar, and hop varietals of sticky nectars, citrics, and herbal depth. With warmth the booze comes out as well, but it is sweeter rather than burning and fusel. Our first impression is that the hops are explosive, fresh, and tangy, with drinkability for years, and an insanely cleansing and balanced finishing that leaves your mouth dripping wet with salivation for that next sip. As we taste, the flavor opens with raw honey sweetness, white sugars, sweet pear, pineapple, tangerine, and golden delicious fruitiness, brightly citric and bitterly herbal hops, flashes of lemon juiciness, faint brandy booziness, and pale, lightly toasted and powdered malts. The middle comes to a peak with dill weed, vegetal pepper metallics, biting plastics, and continued pear and blueberry fruitiness, along with the sweetest, most nectary hops of the sip. Tannic lemon teas and those crisp pales also rides high across the palate, pulling us into a finish with a hop profile most similar to the beginning of the sip, when held in the mouth. Here you get that fresh earthy and herbal hop bite, with black pepper and continued dill herbals, dripping pine sap, clove honey, honeysuckle florals, green twig, lemon rind tang, bready pales, faint rye crustiness, coiny metallic yeast, and light parsnip vegetals. The aftertaste breathes of crisp bready toastiness, clean pale malt sweetness, light rye twang, graphite, chalked yeastiness, aromatic mossy and musky rumbles, toasted pistachio nuts, bitter herbal hoppiness, and those sticky sweet nectary and lightly resiny hops. The body is medium, and carbonation is high, but not offensive or overly prickled. Each sip gives soft and syrupy slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop. The mouth is left foamy, coated, and dripping wet with salivation. There is mild puck from the hoppiness of it all, added to by alcohol, especially as the beer warms. The abv is appropriate, hardly noticed, and nicely contributory, and the beer drinks like water. "
"Heady Topper","Brought eight cans back from a trip to the cannery in March of 2013. "
"Heady Topper","Bought a case of this from The Alchemist on Memorial Day, have been making my way through it over the past month. Sat down to do a couple proper reviews of it in the last week or so, so these notes are on cans that have ~3.5 weeks on them."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to JOSHMAN for this one (and three others)!"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Dee at Bobby's Liquor for this one!"
"Heady Topper","a) silver and black can with a neat logo :) its hard to judge this since the can so explicitly says to drink it from the can...not sure what a proper # rating would be since you can't actually see the beer."
"Heady Topper","I recently had a chance to taste the legendary Heady Topper, and it was truly a ground breaking experience for me. This is the essence of what most IPA's strive to be, but come up a bit short. The aroma is floral and fruity in all the right ways, the head is moderate when poured, and the appearance is a thick, luscious, golden color with it's unfiltered qualities lending to it's bold appearance."
"Heady Topper","Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a stark white bubbly head. The aroma is great. The second the can pops you can smell the hops. The aroma is of piney hops and floral hops. It smells like an earthly flower shop. The taste follows suit, there is no ripe your face of bitterness just a great blended flavor. The malts are there as the backbone, but the hops play out with piney earthy hops up front before a floral and citrus hop flavor comes through at the end. The mouthfeel is perfect. Overall this beer is as good as advertised. A great beer a must try."
"Heady Topper","Poured a chug into pint glass just to see what it looked like. Drank rest out of can."
"Heady Topper","Tall boy can"
"Heady Topper","I knew I'd tick this one eventually without having to actively seek it out. Success! Thanks Dan for the share on your extra. 2 oz. into a tulip so I could mark the visuals and aroma, another 3-4 oz. straight from the can on June 14th, 2013."
"Heady Topper","The hype of this beer made me want it. Got it on a beer trade from a bloke in nj. Opened the can and dug my nose in it... So delicious. Super hop aroma and pine. Put a chug in my mouth and swished it around like scope and put it down. Then came. Nothing more."
"Heady Topper","The Alchemist Heady Topper"
"Heady Topper","I have been craving this beer ever since I heard about and through the generosity of fellow BAs, I am able to enjoy it multiple times."
"Heady Topper","I have to say that I was impressed by this beer. I only managed to have a couple of sips since i was sharing the one can we found we a couple of friends but i found this beer to be very,. very enjoyable."
"Heady Topper","16 ounces of perfection. Amazing head and deep copper body. Smells of sticky hops and strong sweet malty goodness. "
"Heady Topper","Reviewed from notes. Finally getting around to typing it up. Full disclosure, I drank a lot of Heady over a several month period and so my review ultimately takes into account my judgments across many samples."
"Heady Topper","A: Golden honey brown colored body with a bubbly, rocky and creamy looking head. A nice retention ring is left behind, along with sticky lace on the walls. Unfiltered floaties are unmistakable in the body, as mentioned there might be should you pour this out. Really, they're just ugly and kill the looks of the beer. I can't help but think this is part of the reason they recommend drinking from the can (other than the hop aroma retention)."
"Heady Topper","473ml can served in a tulip (to take a look in the appearance) and also drunk from the can as suggested by the brewer."
"Heady Topper","An east coast DIPA trying to be an west coast DIPA. Pours a very cloudy light amber to dark golden color. A good carbonation with good retention through the tasting."
"Heady Topper","The artwork ok the can itself is killer. Although it clearly states to drink straight from the can I opted instead to pour this one into a tulip to scope it out. Very hazy burnt orange in color, minimal head and lots of ""floaties"" that anyone whos done any research has been warned about. "
"Heady Topper","Perfectly balanced IPA. Great Hoppy flavor, not overly bitter and very drinkable. The smell hits you when opening the can. The fruity/floral flavor hits your palate instantly and lasts. They recommend that you drink it out of the can, but I tried it both from can and glass and found no difference."
"Heady Topper","Sampled from a can in a standard pint glass. Thanks surge1311!"
"Heady Topper","Appearance- Poured about 6oz into a snifter before drinking the rest from the can. Pours a hazy yellow-orange with an inch of head that quickly fades to a film of bubbles on the surface. Some sediment but this pour was off the top of the can so it isn't bad. "
"Heady Topper","16 oz can courtesy of tommyguz pours an uber-hazed gold color with a stubborn, sticky off white head. It's money on retention and lacing."
"Heady Topper","It may sound blasphemous, but really not much separates a lot of the top American IPAs - Sculpin, Resin, Double Jack, etc. They're extremely good, but somewhat similar. But Heady Topper has that x factor that keeps you wanting more. Not sure if it's the well-rounded mouthfeel or supremely fresh taste. It's just infinitely drinkable."
"Heady Topper","I finally got my hands on some HT, and in one of the most unlikely places of all. A cheese and wine shop. Through word of mouth I got the scoop that there's some HT a few doors down, so I had to take the rest of the afternoon to dabble. "
"Heady Topper","Great nose! Excellent hazy orange color with substantial white head. I had this from the can, but would love to try it on tap. The on-can instructions to drink it directly from the can are a little disconcerting for the average beer snob. We like glassware!"
"Heady Topper","This is quite the beer with the only downside being the appearance, which is probably why the brewer suggests drinking it from the can. "
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a very cloudy (mostly opaque) straw color, with 1.5 fingers of white head, composed of small and medium bubbles. The head dissolved into a think film pretty quickly. The little bit I poured did leave moderate+ lacing on the glass. Looks unfiltered, as there are some particulates in the ounce or so that I poured."
"Heady Topper","One of my all time favorites. I've had this many times, but finally doing a proper review."
"Heady Topper","Straight from can as recommended, 10 min out of the fridge."
"Heady Topper","Excellent double IPA, there is a reason why this beer is #1. The smell, the taste, and the feel of this hoppy conconction of godliness are all there and do not disappoint. I'm hoping to get my hands on another 1 soon. Definitely worth the hype, cheers to Alchemist!"
"Heady Topper","Headed across the lake to Winooski Beverage to grab some of these bad boys. Needed to know if this beer lived up to the reviews. It did!"
"Heady Topper","Huge, huge, thanks to MrKennedy for this. Believe to be two-three weeks old max."
"Heady Topper","A - Drinking from a can so really can't rate appearance."
"Heady Topper","With huge, massive thanks to the exceedingly generous Owen (MrKennedy)."
"Heady Topper","Canned on 6/3/2013; enjoyed on 6/6/2013."
"Heady Topper","16oz can, huge thanks to Chris for sending this out here. Canned 15 May."
"Heady Topper","Ok so this beer says to drink out of the can, so I am reviewing this beer drinking one from the can and one poured into a glass on a separate session. So the look isn't good. Tons of grainy sediment but to be fair they do tell you to keep it in the can for smell reasons, but after seeing it in a glass I call BS and say this is why they don't want you to see it. The smell is a hoppy citrus explosion. Might be the most citrus I've ever smelled in a beer. Most importantly the taste, and the taste is pretty good and smooth on some tastes and others a little more harsh. Never bad but kind of inconsistent taste through the beer. Overall, it's a good beer but not great, or for that matter the best rating on advocate. Double IPAs is perhaps the most competitive class of beers and I have definitely had better than this."
"Heady Topper","Have to give a shout out to ffOpusx for sharing this brew. Great, multi-dimensional fresh hop nose that unfortunately doesn’t carry over into the flavor. The floaties are also extremely offputting, and simply suggesting that the beer be drunk out of the can doesn’t get Alchemist off the hook for such a shoddy presentation."
"Heady Topper","A - Only because I poured the first can, I can report that the Heady Topper pours into a chalice the color of straw, hazy, and an ample white head."
"Heady Topper","A big thanks to Roger at Bestway for GIVING me this beer on Sunday.I know it's snobbery but I can't drink beer out of a can,I hate myself but I just can't.Pours a murky kind of lemony tea looking with a thin white head,the color was hard to pinpoint.Pure hops in the nose,tropical fruit, citrus rind,deep pine resin,and sweet alcohol,all make for a volitile mix.Just hops and lots o' hops on the palate,pine resin,deep overripe tropical fruits,and some bitterness in the finish.It's oily as all get out and slick in the mouth.This beer is pretty damn raw and complex in the hop department to the hilt,bad ass.I love the hop burps!"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can, per its request. Having had it both ways, however, I can attest that my evaluation remains a perfect score regardless."
"Heady Topper","This beer reminded me a of a springtime night in Paris."
"Heady Topper","Found this little brewery while on vacation up in VT. This is by far one of the best Imperial IPA's I had. It's unfiltered and has an Extremely hoppy aroma with a great balance composure of grains. I didn't believe the Alchemist brewery beer hype in VT until I went there myself. It was unbelievable! Great imperial IPA!"
"Heady Topper","Since the obvious reformulation of this once great beer it has become a harsh onion flavored mess of a product."
"Heady Topper","Got a case from zrab11! Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","I have been an IPA nut for years now and nothing has compared to Heady Topper. The combination of hop bitterness and citrus flavor with a great mouthfeel make it nearly a perfect beer. I first tried HT back in December and since then have been yearning for more. I have tried to consume more available IPAs but nothing has compared, even other world class beers such as Double Trouble and LagunitasSucks. So today I went up to VT with some friends and picked up 6 cases. No more worrying for me. Its a shame more cannot try this great beer."
"Heady Topper","A buddy of mine brought this beer down from Vermont.. I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. The HOPS are fully vibrant and tasty. I have never drank anything as full bodied, as at times I did not believe that a beer so wonderful could be crafted in the USA. However, I am in love with this beer.. I am hoping to have it again one day."
"Heady Topper","Finally got my hands on a 4-pack of cans. Enjoying my first as I write this review. I think I'm in love."
"Heady Topper","Bought from a Charity Auction with the proceeds going to ""Open the Taps"": A grassroots organization of Texas craft beer consumers."
"Heady Topper","Excellent in a manner I don't need to explicate, since everyone else has already done that. It's not, however, the beer beer I've ever had, nor even the best recent-vintage IPA. The hop profile is wonderfully vareigated and citrusy, but also gets a bit unpleasantly heavy in the back end. The malt is totally subordinate to the hops--as is customary for this new style of IPA--but in order for this to work the hop profile must balance itself perfectly. Heady's doesn't. It comes close, and the beer is still a joy, but it's not quite perfect."
"Heady Topper","Absolutely love me some Topper. This is by far one of the best beers that I have had. The only other beer in my opinion is the triple play ipa from Lawsons. They upped their production so its pretty easy to get. Still sells out the day of delivery though.."
"Heady Topper","Canned 5/15"
"Heady Topper","Received in a trade from Jeremy6566. Thanks for letting me get my first taste of Heady, greatly appreciated. Poured a little from the can just to see what it looks like, and consumed the rest from the can as advised."
"Heady Topper","Picked up a few cases from the brewery this morning. Had first can with my dad this afternoon."
"Heady Topper","16oz can, poured into a glass for the purposes of reviewing in comparison to other DIPAs, even though they say to drink it from the can."
"Heady Topper","A: Hazy, golden yellow with a fluffy, white head. Gets lumpy with some head retention. Some good lace."
"Heady Topper","Drank out of a can because it told me to, canned the day before. huge shoutout to bringing this to Boston after a depressing news release from alchemist. "
"Heady Topper","Wow. I kept reading the hype but finally got some of this. What an incredible beer. The aroma from the can is full....but not overpowering. The taste....is refreshing. So refreshing. The aftertaste is a wonderful complement. The ranking of this beer is not hype. I am half way through the can and know I would drive a far distance to load up on this."
"Heady Topper","Review from notes accumulated while going through a case of HT over 4 weeks. First can was 4 days old, last can was right around a month. Mostly poured into tulips, but had a few straight from the can, too."
"Heady Topper","Drinking from a 16 ounce can, per the can's request. Thanks for this one Cheesemoose. No freshness date. I'm told that this is a ""fresh"" can. Still not sure why everyone isn't dating their beers. Popped the can, aroma is bursting out of the little hole, pine, grapefruit, packed full of hops, awesome aroma. Taste is resinous and flavorful. Mainly grapefruit but notes of grass and pine. Totally juiced with flavor. Even the burps taste good."
"Heady Topper","Can &gt; 2xIPA Glass"
"Heady Topper","I've been lucky enough to have this both right out of the can (as suggested) and poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Huge thanks to my buddy Doug and my co-worker Zach for hooking me up two separate times with this gem. This review is from a 5 day old can that was consumed half in a glass and half in the can..."
"Heady Topper","Had an unexpected opportunity to buy this from someone so jumped on it. Never thought I'd get a chance."
"Heady Topper","I didn't see the beer in a glass as I drank it from the can as recommended, but I imagine it is beautiful judging from the smell. I also drank it a little on the cold side... to thirsty to wait. Taste is fruitful and as smooth as in Imp IPA gets. Hoppy as hell in the best way. Again, very smooth. I drink IPA's 90% of the time and I cant say I have had a better beer."
"Heady Topper","Heady is the real deal. "
"Heady Topper","Very smooth on the mouthfeel with excellent golden color. Very complex flavors, including a slight metallic taste which is common to IPA's of this type. Overall, excellent in all categories. The brewer encourages one to drink from the can, which isn't typical, but definitely adds to the experience."
"Heady Topper","A - Golden/Amber, hazy, 2+ inches big thick fluffy head, light patchy lacing, light carbonation rising, large amount of yeast."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip"
"Heady Topper","Managed to get 2 cans of this thanks to the kindness of another BA. This is a quick review based on drinking the first one straight outta the can, as directed by said can. I'll review again out of a glass with the next one. No discernible freshness or 'drink by' date to be found."
"Heady Topper","I wish this beer was a fruit or a vitamin. I wish it was a soap. I wish it was my girlfriend. I wish it was my job. I wish I needed it to live. I wish it wasn't so hard to come across. I want a swimming pool full of Heady Topper that I can freeze in the winter and skate on. I would move to Vermont for this beer. If there is a better beer regularly available on this planet, please by all means let me know of it."
"Heady Topper","Got to try this for the first time last night at an Allagash tasting event at Decicco's in Brewster. "
"Heady Topper","I had a customer give me a can of Heady last year. Split it with one of my coworkers and we both just looked at each other with mouths open before both exclaiming how good it was. I picked up my share at the brewery little over a week ago and now it's time for a full review."
"Heady Topper","16oz can with about the first 1/4 drank out of the can, the rest poured into a FFF teku glass and consumed today 5/10/13. Thanks to shagens for the opportunity to drink this 1.5-2 week old Heady."
"Heady Topper","16oz can - Started drinking right from the can and then poured into an oversized stemmed tulip."
"Heady Topper","I've had this beer out of the can and now straight from the can. Less than 2 week old can."
"Heady Topper","pint can half poured into sam adams perfect glass and half in can."
"Heady Topper","the look outside of the can is super hazy....but what do you expect with this many hops! the foamy light head persisted till the end of the glass."
"Heady Topper","i searched low and high for this bad boy. i listened to the directions and drank straight from the can. no idea how old it was when i got it. IPA's are my go to all the time, and this thing is awesome. i will say not worth the $15 a can ive seen charged for it, but i'd drop an easy $8 on it."
"Heady Topper","Had a real hard time getting this beer. A friend hooked me up with 1 can from his 4 pack."
"Heady Topper","I'm so glad that angrybabboon could provide me plenty of these for the coming weeks. I've already had this once, but I'm reviewing it today 15 days since canning day - about the widely considered perfect time to drink this. For this review, I got a bit experimental. I love how this is in the can, but I poured it alongside in a glass and reviewed both side by side - half in the glass, with the other half in the can. Poured into a teku glass."
"Heady Topper","My homeboy Javier at Vendome Wine and Spirits in Placentia had a can of this. He knows to go to the backroom where he keeps all his exclusive collection when I arrive. He brought a can of this out and I asked him what he would trade for it. He said he would take $4. What a steal! I shared it with my other homeboys at Art and Craft Brews (and homegirls). They all got excited when I showed up with it. You should have seen their eyes open up and mouth the words Oh My God! So here is my review, trying my very best not to be biased since I'm west coast and the west is the best..."
"Heady Topper","Having had this beer on multiple occasions...I can not say enough about Heady Topper. When compared to the other top DIPA's I've had there is a few traits that set this beer apart from the rest. The main two are its balance and drink-ability. It is an unrelenting wave of hops across the palate yet still has you coming back for more. "
"Heady Topper","This is one well hyped beer. Usually that would make for some disappointment, however this one lives up to the hype... Almost. I had a friend from NH ship out a 4 pack about six months ago, of which I distributed 3 and drank one. I have just had a case shipped out, and am enjoying the rare nice weather here with this beer."
"Heady Topper","Oh man look out for the hype train!!! ;)"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can itself, but served a portion of it unto a 3 ounce snifter for appearance purposes. "
"Heady Topper","Poured into glass despite what the can said, super hazy with lots of bits and what looks like hop bits floating around in a bright orange glow. Sticky bright white head. Tons of resinous hops on the nose. Grapefruit pine citrus and floral."
"Heady Topper","Canned May 1, reviewed May 4. Poured into HF stemware and also had a few straight from the can. From notes. Minor updates from mid-November. Minor updates added in November."
"Heady Topper","Cans received from a fellow BA bud 5/4/13. Believed to be within a couple weeks of being canned."
"Heady Topper","A-Drank from the can per Alchemist's suggestion, but I'm sure it looks fine."
"Heady Topper","16oz Tall Boy purchased from the cannery hours earlier. Consumed from the can. Appearance is a murky dishwater color with sediment. Aroma is uber hoppy. Big grapefruit with sweet citrus and tropical fruits. Outstanding. Taste mirrors the aroma. Lots of hoppy goodness. Plenty of grapefruit along with citrus peel and hints of pine towards the end. Tropical notes as well. Pineapple. Dry, oily mouthfeel. Bitter and delicious. Highly drinkable. Amazing brew. Overall, hype warranted."
"Heady Topper","I was able to have this on-tap at the brewery when I went to pick-up some cases, and have had a couple directly from the can as well as in a snifter. "
"Heady Topper","Long awaited, and well worth the wait! A friend brought me back a can from a trip to Vermont...a very good friend indeed!"
"Heady Topper","This is simply a great beer. "
"Heady Topper","No Bottle date( it is two week's old, I had a buddy pick it up at the brewery in Vermont, big thanks to IPAkindaguy)"
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a rich orange color, with a nice inch thick white head. Tons of sediment floating in the glass. Gives the appearance that they're suspended in a jello mold. Not the most appetizing start."
"Heady Topper","Doing this from memory so my rating counts.  Haven't had this in a year.  But from what I remember the smell when you open the can is heavenly.  Tropical fruit and pine.  The taste is a mix of citrus fruits and peaches with a nice resiny pine bitterness.  I'm a huge fan of both the fruitiness and pine mix so this is perfect for me.  Fresh Heady is great but it gets better if you wait a month or so to consume."
"Heady Topper","Against the demands written on the can I poured it into two wine glasses and shared with Steve 28/4/13"
"Heady Topper","The beer is excellent overall. A phenomenal nose of citrus starts it off, smooth citrus flavors, cooling and slightly sweet touch the front and mid palate with a trumpet of hoppiness on the finish. A very inviting, thirst quenching, taste-bud delighting IPA."
"Heady Topper","This beer is hard to get but well worth it if you can. Pours cloudy golden (yes I know you should drink from the can). Smell is spicy fruit and woodsy. Taste has unreal with banana, pine, peppery but with a great mouthfeel and aftertaste that lingers in a good way. A bit more carbonation and aftertaste than Pliny but in a good way. I think it slightly edges out Pliny but both are amazing"
"Heady Topper",Appearance-
"Heady Topper","Pours a deep orange almost amber or brown with a frothy off white two finger head leaving supreme lacing down the glass. Smells of pineapple, tropical fruits and a little bit of caramel. Everything about this beer is fantastic so far. Strong citrus flavors hit at the front of the tongue balanced out in the middle with some caramel malt. Finishes with a light piney resin bitterness. A little bit sappy and good carbonation levels."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper-The Alchemist-Vermont. Ale. Alc. 8% by Vol.,1 pint."
"Heady Topper","Poured it into a tulip, glad I did even with the floaties.. It was quite tasty, I even drank the protein globs. Worth it. Would love to get a hold of another can asap.. I would drink it from the can itself on the next try. I love this beer, it deserves the 100 rating it has earned."
"Heady Topper","I know nothing of reviews. All I know is that I heard about this beer a month ago. I live in NY and decided to take a road trip to get some at 4+ hours away. To find out they were sold out. Sold out. What brewery sells out? One that has great beer! Had a sample, it was good, went home. Returned a month later, bought a couple of cases, sent some to friends, all are happy. I've tried from both can and glass. From the can, it has a bit sharper taste/feel. What I didnt like from the can is that you couldnt smell it as well. From the glass, a bit less carbonated, much better smell, and an excellent drink. Color? Who cares? Cloudy, very little sediment. You dont look at it, you drink it! You CANNOT have just one to make a review. Give your palette time. Have 3 or 4 (yes, its ok!!) and then review it. This beer gets better each and every time. As someone else said, its like biting into a grapefruit, and like the can says, its wave after wave of hoppyness. Hands down the best beer I've ever had. Be patient, get a 4 pack, and do an informed review. You wont be disappointed! I can't wait for my next road trip! And... they are compassionate! They are donating some beer to my tribute race to a late friend. I will never forget that. Nothing like a company with a heart and compassion and PASSION!"
"Heady Topper","So freaking excited to finally try this!"
"Heady Topper","This is a combo review since I've had the privilege of tasting this on-tap at the cannery, from the can, and from The Alchemist-branded IPA glass."
"Heady Topper","This was a bucket list beer for me that was well worth the hype. I really hope to get some more in a future beer trade. "
"Heady Topper","beer is heaven. It's fantastic on tap and one of the best canned dipas out there. Makes my Vermont pilgrimage to my grandmoms place in vt that much better."
"Heady Topper","I was a sucker for the hype of this beer. I had tried a full gamut of attempts to acquire it from Wisconsin, but alas all of my attempts failed. Until roughly a month later my wife let me know she had a friend whose family was in Vermont at the time and that they were willing to pick some up and drive it back for me. After visiting 3 liquor stores that were completely sold out they found the miracle brew and brought back 16 cans in a cooler of ice they repeatedly replenished to ensure it never got warm. When it arrived my wife, my friend and I took a moment to enjoy the moment and shared 1 can. Despite being directed to drink it only out of the can we each poured a glass and were in awe of its hazy golden body. The first sip told us everything we needed to know. The rich full bodied taste was complimented with a smooth finish for an IPA bragging a bold 8.0% abv. I won't get into the specifics because there are many others more qualified to do so, but what I will say is that everyone who can appreciate the complexities and flavor of real beer needs to have this at some point in their life."
"Heady Topper","This particular can was sent to me by JSBILK, after he picked it up at the cannery six days ago. Poured from a 16 oz. tallboy can into a tulip glass. I know I know, I'm supposed to drink it from the can, but I never was very good at following directions."
"Heady Topper","A: Glorious murky dark amber pour, with big white rocky head that held for a bit. This is what a DIPA should look like!"
"Heady Topper","This is a wonderful local beer! Its wonderful to be able to go to the brewery to purchase it, so much more personal than just picking it up in the grocery store. The beer is super hoppy and only comes in a can. The second you enter its brewery, you can just smell HOPS! This is the best double IPA I've ever had."
"Heady Topper","After having Maine Brew Co. Lunch, I just don't get why this is #1"
"Heady Topper","This is my second - thanks to SDStoneEnthusiast! The first I poured into an English pint glass and followed directions for the second (drank from the can). I understand now why they are so adamant about drinking from the can - such a difference."
"Heady Topper","Poured from can into a tulip. Pours a clear gold color with a very foamy head."
"Heady Topper","A: Perfect looking unfiltered IPA. Completely opaque due to dense haze - the color is a beautiful blend of sunshine and orange juice. A nice, slightly off white head coats the top of the beer and leaves great sticky lacing."
"Heady Topper","After several cans, time for a review."
"Heady Topper","Poured out of a can, 1 day after canning."
"Heady Topper","Just straight up awesome."
"Heady Topper","So I've had Heady Topper before. Figured I'd finally review it. This review is going to be pretty harsh since I drink PtE regularly on tap at the pub."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into my snifter. Huge thanks to Urbancaver for sending four of these, along with some KRE and HF. Good trade, let's do it again. Can is seventeen days old."
"Heady Topper","First off, many thanks to SammyJaxxxx who sent me some of this out of the blue."
"Heady Topper","""Grapefruit Bomb"" is a highly overused term, yet it pretty much nails the flavor of Heady Topper: so many of the super hopped-up ales have a strong bitter aftertaste.HT has just the right combination of pleasant bitterness on the palate and carbonation, making it a superbly brewed DIPA, one that is very drinkable,and most enjoyable from start to finish. "
"Heady Topper","I will agree with what's been said - this isn't the prettiest beer. But of the reviewing categories, it's certainly the least important factor to me. Drank mostly from the can, but poured a bit into a tulip to see what it looks like. Wonderful hop aroma and taste. It's easy to be disappointed by heavily-hyped beers but this doesn't disappoint."
"Heady Topper","poured half into a mini tulip, drinking the rest from the can."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can directly from the vessel to my mouth. I poured a fraction for appearance."
"Heady Topper","Review is done on can that was picked up from Alchemist and delivered with less than 2 weeks on it. Ratings are done from beer out of can as is intended to be drank. "
"Heady Topper","The first words I heard about this from a cicerone buddy was ""please, don't drink it from the can like they say."" So, I poured 80% into a glass and left the rest in the can. After it hit the glass, I understood the desire for the can. The unfiltered, resin-floating view was less than flattering. But, I figured, two million people can't all be wrong. So I took a whiff, and enjoyed the crisp, apricot notes coming back at me. Nothing piney, no citrus, just clean. Next was where the rubber meets the road - the taste. My wife summed it up best, when she said ""wow, an IPA I wouldn't have to pair with food to drink!"" I absolutely agree. It's perfectly brewed, and is surely the best, most balanced IPA I've ever had. First taste threatens to turn into piney hops in your mouth, yet never does. It just slides away, leaving you with a tasty, refreshing treat that doesn't stay past its welcome. Now I know why this is such a revered brew, and why people love to have more than one at a time. It's just that inviting, and one I wish was closer to me in availability."
"Heady Topper","No can date but I know it's pretty fresh from the source. Drank about half from the can as it says to do so numerous times. Poured the other half into a DFH snifter."
"Heady Topper","Look: hazy and light orange, nice lingering head"
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip, no I didn't leave it in the can. "
"Heady Topper","April 14th, 2013"
"Heady Topper","Heavenly. The stuff you dream about. Like anything else in VT, very, very fresh. I had it at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury on tap. Haven't stopped thinking about it since. I'll be with everyone else, on the road to VT just to get some as it's only available there. It's that good."
"Heady Topper","I'm enjoying a Heady Topper right now. All around, its an incredible drink. It's become the beer that I judge other beers against. The flavor is bone deep, The aftertaste stays with me for minutes. When swishing it around in my mouth it turns into this delicious creamy foam. Its what I want other beers to taste like. Man, this is the real deal. I can't think of anything I don't like about the stuff."
"Heady Topper","No date on the can, drank the first half from the can, poured second half into a snifter. "
"Heady Topper","I've tried many many IPAs and there's only 1 that has come close to Heady. It really is the most amazingly over the top yet balanced IPA I've ever tried."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to sirsteve42 for the trade."
"Heady Topper","Finally got around to writing the full review of this guy. I'm glad I waited; now I have a full mode of comparison after trying some of, what I consider to be, the best iipas out there (DS, S&S4, Ephraim, and Abner). Beer pours hazy amber into a Duvel tulip. Has a slight red glow."
"Heady Topper","Living in San Francisco (a couple of miles from Toronado) I've been privy to a lot of ""West Coast IPAs,"" PtE, PtY, etc. The Heady Topper defiantly can hold it's own in this category and tak ehte top spot in the Top 250. "
"Heady Topper","Had it first from the can in VT, once more in PA."
"Heady Topper","I thought my first full review should follow my first can of Heady. Thanks to patric11 for the trade on this one. Was told it was picked up from the brewery on 8/2/2013."
"Heady Topper","I made it up to Waterbury last weekend and had my first (and 5th) Heady Topper on that visit. I went into the weekend figuring it couldn't be as good as all the hype. I also doubted whether drinking anything out of a can would be one of my best beer drinking experiences. I was blown away by how great this tasted and by how drinkable it was. I had a game plan to try the first one in the can (per the instructions on the can) and then try one in a glass so I could see what I was drinking...I scrapped this plan after tasting how good the first one was in the can. The rest of my tastes were directly from the can. Apparently there are only two places that serve this beer on draft (the brewery and the Prohibition Pig)....the rest of the places in town serve it in a can (when they can get it). "
"Heady Topper","Though a very good IPA, I wouldn't consider HT in the same breath as either Pliny. I think with this beer we have an extreme case of confirmation bias. I can think of 5 or 6 other beers I'd rather drink. I drank my first HT a couple hours after it was canned."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a goblet style glass also sipped from the can &lt;not recommended"
"Heady Topper","Poured gently into a pint glass"
"Heady Topper","This is not a balanced beer by any means. If you're a hops lover, this beer certainly celebrates it like no other. It's almost comical and whimsical if I had to think of fundamental words to describe it. When you first crack open the can, you get hit with a sledgehammer of aroma; notes of citrus and pine hit you hardest. With every sip, the bitterness provides for a lingering complexity that makes this beer unique."
"Heady Topper","A - (only poured a little out to see) cloudy, kinda apple juicey, small white head, but since your supposed to drink it outa the can, amazing can art, really cool looking and nice write up on the beer."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to warnerry for supplying!"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Trevor at Pinnochio's for this very surprising gift!"
"Heady Topper","After much searching I finally got a can of this at The Churchville Inn. Poured into a tulip, a very hazy golden color with alot of hop sediment at the bottom of the glass. Left a nice two finger heading with soapy rings left over after every sip. A non-stop fizzing action from the bottom of the glass to the surface."
"Heady Topper","After receiving this in a generous pre-wedding gift-box of beers from a friend, I too neglected the bold warning to only drink this straight out of the can. I really wanted to see the beer I was drinking so I busted out a frosted mug for the occasion."
"Heady Topper","I also didn't buy into the hype of ""Drink it from the Can"" because I wanted to see what I was working with. I can see why they wanted me to though, because there was a ton of gnarly looking sediment in my glass when it was all said and done."
"Heady Topper","Outstanding in every respect, fresh and wonderfully aromatic. Little cloudy, so there's that. "
"Heady Topper","Straight from the can."
"Heady Topper","I was hoping to find the Holy Grail of beers but it wasn't quite there. Doing as they say and drinking it from the can, you can't really gauge the appearance. Quite smooth and complex but I find Stone's Enjoy By a bit better to my taste. Heading to San Fran in the summer. Hoping that Pliny the Elder can match the hype."
"Heady Topper","My first Heady Topper"
"Heady Topper","A: poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass, orange amber with a huge white head that lingers leaving great lacing, very cloudy with floaties"
"Heady Topper","Happy to say I'm no longer a Heady Topper virgin. I live in CT and a friend made the trip to VT recently and grabbed ONE can for me. Best IPA I've ever had. It set the bar impossibly high for any other IPA out there. The freshest and most incredible hops in this brew. Amazing stuff."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to kojevergas for this one!"
"Heady Topper","Not following the instructions listed on the can, I poured into a tulip. Canned within the week."
"Heady Topper","A: Poured a white foam which dissipated slowly with excellent lacing. Nice golden color and a bit cloudy."
"Heady Topper","I can't report much on appearance because I tried this as directed - from the can. Nose was citrus - grapefruit, mango and pineapple along with some pine, grassiness and floral elements. Taste followed with big citrus flavors, especially grapefruit and orange, but with a biscuity, caramel malt for balance. Bitterness was there but not overwhelming. It predominates in the aftertaste as well, along with pine oil and honey. Mouthfeel was medium and mildly carbonated. There is little to no alcohol burn. I can understand why so many people love this beer…it was great…just not my all-time favorite, as it is for so many."
"Heady Topper","A - Instructed to drink from the can - have never viewed the beer. Appearance of can has cool illustration of man with hair on hop fire."
"Heady Topper","Ok, another double IPA. Hoppy, we get it right? So what is so great abut THIS Ipa? If you were to break the rules and not ""drink it IMMEDIATELY out of the can"" you end up with a foggy IPA with chunks of hop pellets to chew on while they add to the hoppiness. As it sits, the trub gathers as gravity wins the battle to the bottom of my glass. Don't get me wrong, the hop particles that are suspended add a decent profile to the beer, but at what cost? I think it would be great as a ""harvest IPA"" if vegetal matter was the intention but there are another 11.5 months to use your hops in that case. "
"Heady Topper","First time I had I received it in a Reddit trade two weeks before my Vermont trip, but then consumed in glorious excess directly from the source in Waterbury."
"Heady Topper","poured 16oz can into Duvel tulip."
"Heady Topper","Easily one of the best DIPAs in the world. Do whatever it takes to get this beer, then be sure to enjoy it quickly!"
"Heady Topper","can &lt;7 days old. "
"Heady Topper","Hands down the most amazing experience I have ever had with a beer. My first taste - likened to the first time I ever...well you know....I don't think I have to elaborate"
"Heady Topper","Consumed from a 16 ounce can. Canned 6 March 2013. I poured an ounce or two into a Glencairn glass for purposes of appearance and smell."
"Heady Topper","On a recent trip to Burlington went to American Farmhouse which had it.... By luck we were able to do live taste tests with some other DIPAs most notibly Stone 4/1 enjoy by"
"Heady Topper",Finally!
"Heady Topper","A-the overall appearance of Heady isn't perfect but when does that matter when the beer is this fabulous, poured a golden honey color slightly cloudy with a monster head that refused to dissipate!"
"Heady Topper","A: Enjoyed a Heady a few weeks ago poured in a glass (from same batch) and wrote down notes on appearance. Poured a white foam which dissipated slowly with excellent lacing. Nice golden color and a bit cloudy."
"Heady Topper","A: drank most of it from the can poured a small amount to see what it looked like Poured a golden color with a sight haze about 1 finger of bright white head with a good amount of lacing"
"Heady Topper","Poured a bit into a tulip, had most straight from the can"
"Heady Topper","9 day old can poured into a snifter for inspection (inductions be damned!). Very hazy, between straw and copper in color. Fluffy head which recedes to a thin cap. Pretty."
"Heady Topper","OK, while everyone else in Philly is drinking Pliny the Younger today, I decided to avoid the crowds and review this beauty. I sampled this a few weeks ago, and really wanted to NOT like this beer so much. But that is impossible. Anyone who likes beer would fall in love with this..."
"Heady Topper","I reviewed this beer out of a can without pouring it so I do not having any appearance notes. I have had a sampling of this once before, poured into a glass and the color was a deep orange or amber. Pretty hazy as well."
"Heady Topper","16oz. tall silver bullet can with a sweet ass picture. The label is that of a bearded scientist chugging a beer with his hair bursting with hop buds. It's something you need to see for yourself. The back of the can has a lengthy paragraph about the beer and the Government warning. A brewed on or canned on date would have been very helpful. Poured into a Cycle Brewing Snifter. "
"Heady Topper","Reviewed from notes from 3/31/13"
"Heady Topper","Pint can, 1/2 drank from can, 1/2 poured into a tulip. Probably about a month old, so could be fresher."
"Heady Topper","Props to my brother in law for snagging this for me. I've now had Pliny, Heady	 and Hoslam in one winter. Anyway, this stuff looks hazy, smells dank and piney. Tastes bitter pine and I'm not sure what else. Great stuff. Wish I could get it all the time."
"Heady Topper","Per their request, drank it out of the can. Guess I'll have to rate the appearance of the can. Silvery and tall, not the best logo I've ever seen but not too bad. "
"Heady Topper","I took a trip to Vermont with my brother and a friend of mine from Boston for a guys day out. This beer was well worth the 3 hour drive. Normally prefer bottles over cans but this beer was outstanding."
"Heady Topper","Easily in my top 5 Imperial IPA's out there- wonderful aroma every time I pop the can piney and fruity in nature. Taste matches the smell- piney undertones and strong citrus overtones- I generally pick up on grapefruit, pineapple, orange and tangerine.Just the right amount of malty goodness makes this heady retardedly drinkable. If you can get your hands on this brew do so without a second guess- no chance you will ever regret it!"
"Heady Topper","A: tried from the can initially (mandated on the can) - ""cold but not ice cold"" - but then gave in - I had to see what I'm drinking (we are visual creatures): cloudy medium gold beer kicked up a couple of fingers of off-white head from a near-center pour into a tulip. Left some lace behind."
"Heady Topper","16 ounce can poured into a snifter. Big thanks to st9647v3 for this opportunity."
"Heady Topper","OK, here we go. The unofficial holy grail of IPAs. Great appreciation goes out to SatlyMalty for this excellent surprise! Poured into a snifter (screw what the can says). The code on the can is apparently not a freshness date."
"Heady Topper","Drink it from the can...yup, follow the directions printed on the top of the can. The hops are incredible, spicy and super floral. There is plenty of malt to back up the massive amount of hops and it keeps the beer in balance. No question, this certainly ranks up there on the list of greatest beers ever enjoyed. If you are ever in the area of Northern VT and have a chance to pick some up, don't think, just buy it!"
"Heady Topper","Poured out into a glass"
"Heady Topper","Date: 02/13/2013"
"Heady Topper","A- this beer is quite ugly, but like an ugly puppy and you still love it"
"Heady Topper","a: orange/light amber with a creamy off-white head. from what i'd read i was scared of huge fugly floaties. instead i only see some fine particulates in this hazy beer. i can't ding it for being unfiltered."
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can into a proper glass. Since any half knowledgeable beer geek sees right past the whole ""drink it from the can to trap all those hop aromas"" BS. Yeah, I'd like to smell- and hence taste- my beets."
"Heady Topper","A: The beer pours a hazy golden body with a thin white head that quickly fades. It also las some random floaties. "
"Heady Topper","Poured a can into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass."
"Heady Topper","There are several things that make me proud to be from Vermont. This is one of them. This is a hoppy beer, but not one that makes you choke. John Kimmich, the brewer, has somehow taken an extremely hoppy beer and made it so palatable that even people who don't typically like IPA's can enjoy it. I miss the Alchemist of old (Wild Child, Holy Cow, Ouroboros, etc) and hope that Kimmich decides to can those in the future. You can't go wrong with the Alchemist."
"Heady Topper",Appearance:
"Heady Topper","Perfect in lots of ways. The explosion of hoppy goodness is over the top. I've only had it fresh and oh boy is it good. Thought about letting some age but then I read on the can drink it young so here's to all of you cheers! "
"Heady Topper","Really wanted to love this. Maybe something happened on the long trip from VT to CT, but man was it just...okay. Smells fantastic, looks good enough, but it just doesn't taste as good as other IPAs I've had. I hope to give it another shot soon. It probably tastes better than I'm giving it credit for, I think I just got my expectations too high...you know for the #1 rated beer here."
"Heady Topper","Drank 1-31-13"
"Heady Topper","Thanks again to Rutager. "
"Heady Topper","Does appearance include the can? Canned beer with a message ""Drink from the Can"" on it and you know you have a brewer with a sense of humor. If I did that than how do I know what the true appearance is? Pour it into a glass and see the beautiful iridescent orange and a bright white head."
"Heady Topper","Drinking directly from the can as instructed. "
"Heady Topper","Best double ipa around. The nose punches you in the face. I could drink this beer all day even at the higher abv. So much pine. Hazy orange color just how I like it"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Ataraxia, I finally get a chance to slay this one! The directions say ""drink from the can"" but, at least for the first one, I have to pour it out and get a good look at it. Pours a golden-orange color, some straw around the very edges - mostly opaque and hazy. Many people bring up the unadulterated, unfiltered look of Heady Topper, though mine doesn't have the liberal amounts of sediment that would showcase this. Rather it appears quite clean, with maybe a tiny bit of very small particles that have seemingly vanished five minutes into this one. Either way, a nice looking beer with a super foamy, just-off-white head that leaves pretty tremendous lacing atop the glass. "
"Heady Topper","You had this beer. "
"Heady Topper","Pours a murky, pale, wheat golden color with a cottony, stubborn white head. Flecks of barley and vegetable matter float all around the beer. Juicy grapefruit with some pine on the nose. ONce the beer settles, sweeter fruit breaks through. Grapefruit up front then grass and pine emerge. But, the flavor suddenly falls of a cliff for an abrupt finish. Alcohol and unami get picked up right away and pervade throughout. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. It dries a little toward the finish. Pretty big disappointment. Pliny, Abrasive, Sucks, all way superior in my opinion."
"Heady Topper",Update
"Heady Topper","My first go with the one, the only, Heady! Super stoked right now. Fresh 16oz can poured into a tulip (what's the big deal about all the ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"" stuff anyway?) a super hazy, almost totally opaque pastel orange with an initial 2 finger bright white head that recedes quickly to a ring that leaves moderate lacing. A little hop sediment is visible floating around. Great looking beer. "
"Heady Topper","I've enjoyed this beer both on tap and in a can, review based on the can"
"Heady Topper","WOW---a clean crisp ipa that deserves to be on top!"
"Heady Topper","Well being an advocate for Pliny The Elder as the best beer on the planet I was reserved about the hype behind this brew. I do not really know what to say or explain the comparison. Heady Topper is a magnificent massive hop bomb that is amazingly balanced. This brew is World Class and lives up to the hype. I will now travel to Vermont to get more!!! I could drink these one after another enjoying every sip....really just an amazing beer! The bottom line is this is a World Class, top notch, killer IPA that leaves you wanting more."
"Heady Topper","As soon as I opened the can,the fresh aroma of tropical fruits hit me in the nose. The best hop beer ive ever had. Its well balanced aroma is amazing.Just the right amount. The 8.0 abv is perfect too...If you havent tried this beer,seek it out. Its well worth it"
"Heady Topper","So, my first review! Had it a few times, and it's surely the best beer I've had."
"Heady Topper","So lucky to have gotten a 4 pack of this...so selfish that I've only got 1 can for sharing purposes left. "
"Heady Topper","Poured into a pint glass and a nice fluffy head developed which lasted through the drink. Aroma was very hoppy with flower and citris notes. Appearance was a cloudy straw color with nice sediment chunks. Tast was super hoppy with strong flower and hop notes with grain on the back. Mouthfeel was light but with a hint of creamyness. Aftertaste was dry and bitter on the end."
"Heady Topper","I have really been enjoying this beer. Its easily available to me and I find that I'm picking up a four pack of it at least a couple times a week. Seems to be the beer that everyone wants to trade for as well. Overall, it's become my go-to beer. Just like many others, I have tried this poured in a few different glasses but prefer it out of the can."
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into a pint glass. HUGE thanks to kingcrowing for this MAJOR want!!! Reviewed side by side with Pliny the Elder"
"Heady Topper","One of the best beers I've ever tasted. The balance and aroma is top notch. The can is inviting to just grad and take one big long sip. The taste is smooth and full of hoppy goodness. The smell once can is cracked just invites you to drink its deliciousness. My vote for beer of the year!!!"
"Heady Topper","I had this in a glass at lunch and in the can for dinner. Since the brewer recommends drinking directly from the can, that's how I'll rate it....although I will say it's coppery and cloudy in the glass. First off, the aroma is BRILLIANT. This is an awesomely hoppy-smelling beer with notes of candy and tropical fruit (maybe even peach?). The first thing I tasted was the roasty, nutty malts followed by a bitter punch in the mouth! The finish is fruity, falling somewhere between papaya and peach. What I found most surprising was the creamy, soft mouthfeel. This is to date the best beer I've ever had. It's well worth the hype and the drive to VT (since you can't get it anywhere else)."
"Heady Topper","Very few brews make bring a shit eating grin to my face - wow this is good! Starts with a hazy belgian blond hue with a slight finger of creamy white cap that quickly dissipates leaving just a few small islands of foam. Nose brings bright juicy citrus (mandarin, grapefruit) pineapple, slight floral pine, very juice and a hoppy earthiness. This beer reminds me alot of Nelson - big tropical notes and juicy with pine dankiness play a small secondary roll. The taste brings bitter papaya, lime rind, light caramel malts and some pine needle covered forest floor - as it warms almost an herbal, minty licorice note comes out. The mouthfeel is creamy and lush but is quickly balanced by a strong hop bitterness. Best beer not sure about that but at least top 3 ipa's i have ever had and well worth trading for."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper"
"Heady Topper","A- pours a hazy amber with little head. Almost no lacing."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into a nonic, despite the urging of the can. Maybe I'll drink the next one from the can. I left about an eighth inch of beer in the can."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Papat444 for this one. Very excited to try it!"
"Heady Topper","Gifted from BostonRyan, much appreciated. 16 oz can , 8 oz poured into a HF glass and the rest consumed from can as per instructions. 2 weeks fresh."
"Heady Topper","Got this one in a trade. Damn good stuff."
"Heady Topper","Tried this one first in a glass and then straight out of the can. It was definetely more aromatic drunken straight from the can, and my scores in terms of smell, taste and overall are modified with the can session."
"Heady Topper","Served in a tulip with a foamy white two finger head. Hazy straw colored body."
"Heady Topper","Best. Beer. Ever. Well maybe but its incredible. The hops smell from the can is overwhelming. It must be drunk from the can. For all the hops smell the bitterness is smooth and just right. Drink this if you can find it. And if you find it buy me a few extra cases, I will pay ya back!"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can of deliciousness served into a tall tulip."
"Heady Topper","This is definately my favorite IPA."
"Heady Topper","Keeping it simple, this is a fantastic beer worthy of the praise it gets. Great job Alchemist on brewing a single beer perfectly. Please don't change that focus. You can't miss with a singular objective like that! "
"Heady Topper","Second time around with this beer in the last week. "
"Heady Topper","Best way to drink a Heady Topper, pick it up from the Alchemist Brewery on your way to Stowe for an epic day of skiing. Crack that delicious beer on the lift and enjoy, of course remembering to recycle. Ohhhh how I love Vermont. If only Hill Farmstead was on the way to Stowe."
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into a tulip. Big thanks to Kevanb for graciously giving up his last can of this for me to try!"
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper. This is it. This beer in my hand is truly the best DIPA, and maybe the best beer period. Pouring this beer into a brand new tulip glass seems blasphemous given the clear instructions to drink form the can, but I've done that enough, and can't miss an opportunity to enjoy the full sensory experience of HT. "
"Heady Topper","It just hit #1 on BA yesterday, and today he local shop sold out in two hours. Jmscowcroft was able to get a four-pack and set me up but when I went at lunch it was sold out. "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper - 1 Pint - Can"
"Heady Topper","All around best IPA ever. Might be due to how fresh it was, I picked up a case and it was gone within 2 weeks."
"Heady Topper","Yesterday this was #3, new BA format and BOOM #1, tastes even better now!"
"Heady Topper","I snatch one of the four silver cylinders attached together by a molded plastic frame, a classy version of un animal friendly can holder that's been villified accross beaches nationwide. I put my index finger squarely on the tab, and lift it up. I reach the can up to my lips, I've entered Hop Heaven."
"Heady Topper","Amazing aroma of the can! Definitely drink out of the pour a little in a glass so you can remember what the best brew looks like : ) "
"Heady Topper","This beer is one of the best I have ever had. It is strong with a bite. The biggest flavor you will taste is a heavy amount of Grapefruit!"
"Heady Topper","A: The beer is hazy yellow in color and has some hints of amber hues. It poured with a finger high off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin film of bubbles covering the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass. There is a slight amount of carbonation visible along with some fine particles floating in suspension."
"Heady Topper","16oz Can poured into a Duvel tulip."
"Heady Topper","Here I thought Hillfarmstead was a winner! This beer is by far the best kind of brew prolly in the world! If you have not tried Heady Topper, you are nuts. OMG. It made me a believer of hops and the magic is provides when it comes to sleep. Heady Topper is drinkable. I'm telling you right now, it doesn't taste like 8%. So, if you are a fast drinker, a 4 pack should do ya!"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to baconsausage for sending me a four pack as extras (thanks to him for the glass and the other six or seven extras too)."
"Heady Topper","A - Extremely murky. You can barely even see light through this beer. A bit of head. Really something unusual here."
"Heady Topper","Shared with RoninTK3. Served from a pint can into a Smuttynose glass."
"Heady Topper","I took the first few pulls from the can as instructed .... then I poured into a cigar city Tulip glass. I did not enjoy from the can really. I like my IPAs in a glass so I can enjoy the nose."
"Heady Topper","Had on tap in VT and from cans. Review from both glass (tulip/large wine glass) and also from the can. Was canned around 2nd week, December 2012."
"Heady Topper","My friend was in VT skiing over Christmas and was able to get his hands on 6 four-packs. Needless to say it was an amazing New Years!"
"Heady Topper","16oz CANS, served in various goblets over christmas"
"Heady Topper","I first poured a few OZ off to get a look then drank the rest from the can. Pours a hazy amber/straw in color with a pretty standard white head and pretty good lacing, points for the cool can as well. The smell fills the room even from the can resiny, piney, and citrus hops with tropical notes, pretty much any hop smell you can think of rolled into one. Taste of pure hop juice for me, not overly bitter but the can describes it best ""wave after wave of hop goodness"", there are also some malts in there if you try really hard to notice them. The mouthfeel is not all that heavy, the 8% abv is not noticeable at all and if you have access to this one it can be drank can after can. This can was exactly 1 week old."
"Heady Topper","Everything about this beer screams Hop bomb from the beginning"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into a tulip."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Poured a little into a snifter to see what it looked like. Hazy orange/gold. I like the haziness of the beer. foretold of the great things to come."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Presents a slightly hazy honey color capped by a couple of inches of foam; swathes a few strands of lace"
"Heady Topper","Probably one of the best IPA's I have ever tasted! "
"Heady Topper","HUGE want delivered to me by surprise from leschkie (thanks so much!) poured into a New Belgium Globe."
"Heady Topper","Christmas came early this year and I was finally able to get my hands on a Heady Topper in MA! My brew supply store randomly had a 4-pack and the owner was kind enough to give me one."
"Heady Topper","This is one of the best beers i have ever had. Made a trade and pulled some strings and was able to have one for myself within a week of it being canned."
"Heady Topper","Smells so good I want to crawl in the can. Hoppy yet smooth and citrusy. Truly an experience for the DIPA style. I can see why this beer consistently ly gets high reviews. It's a shame it's so difficult to get. This seems to be only avilable in central VT and not the parts of VT that border NY. Bummer...hopefully they will get better distrbution."
"Heady Topper","Simply my favorite beer, hands down. I love the nose on this beer; the grapefruit and other citrus notes are a pleasure. Depending on the time of year and what batch you get, the flavor varies, but it's always delicious. Heck, my only complaint is that it is difficult to acquire down here in the deep south."
"Heady Topper","Poured one in a glass and had another out of the can. It's a pale golden color. Smells of serious oranges, grapefruit, grass, mint, pine. Sweet smelling yet means business. Big hop flavors of deep citrus with sour rind, big gulp of grass, mint, pine, grapefruit towards the finish, strong clean bitterness, booze and sweetness mingle for a vodka-feel and cheddar cheese afterthought. Heavy body with medium carbonation, prickly. Very clean and big on the palate and belly."
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can (broke the ""rules"" on this one) into a Heady Topper stemless wine glass that I picked up from the brewery. This beer was canned 30 days ago as of this review."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 oz can into an oversized wine glass. Thank you Surge1311 for hooking me up with this in a trade. "
"Heady Topper","Received in a recent trade and I'm stoked to be able to finally try this beer... "
"Heady Topper","Have had this several times, attempting my first review of the renowned Heady Topper."
"Heady Topper","Had the 3/4 straight from the can, then poured the rest into a snifter."
"Heady Topper","Boy oh boy oh boy. I've been waiting a long time for this one. Heard the hype for months and finally picked one up locally in SoCal. Yeah, imagine that. I bought a can of this in L.A. at retail. 1 pint aluminum can served into a New Belgium stem-goblet in me gaff in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. 8.00% confirmed. Consumed in celebration of completing my grad school applications. I don't see canned-on date, but my local beer store guy informed me it was two weeks old when I bought it yesterday. "
"Heady Topper","I had read a lot about this beer before i tasted it. It lived up to the hype! A bitter, flowery beast of perfection."
"Heady Topper","I have the wonderful pleasure of living 10 minutes away from The Alchemist cannery, and was a long time patron of their restaurant/brewery before the flood. A skeptic at first, I was amazed at the first run. Not being a huge fan of anything canned, it was such an incredible surprise when I took my first sip. HOPSSS, and such an incredible punch to the mouth of amazing flavors. This is everything a beer should be, and more. Others have written much better/professional reviews. If you question any of them, shoot me a message and let's trade because this brew speaks for itself."
"Heady Topper","Acquired a 4-pack from a trade. No date on this, but it was picked up last week from the brewery. Should only be a couple weeks old at this point."
"Heady Topper","A. It has a lovely deep orange color. Fairly opaque, some sediment. It has a big foamy white head that leaves a good deal of lacing."
"Heady Topper","Thanks go to my cousin Jeff for picking this up for me from the cannery. Even though it says to drink it from the can, I prefer it from the glass. The first thing you notice as you pop the top is the wonderful aroma, ton of oranges, citrus, pine and tropical fruit. It pours a deep orange, moderate white head, big chunky floaters. The flavor is fresh citrus, tropical fruit, bitter pine. IMO the hoppiest beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. The body is medium, some noticeable booze, decent carbonation. Great DIPA, pretty much lives up to hype."
"Heady Topper","As good as it gets, this beer makes you smile from ear to ear. As soon as it gets close enough to your face you know something worthwhile is about to hit the fan; shit the golden goose would be envious to produce and all the hyperbole I can write in the name of an awesome beer. From the smell to the initial taste on your lips, it's a fall in love experience that very few beers can replicate. I advise you to seek out this beer and have at it. Unfortunately, i've only had a few to the head but i've sampled it a often enough and it's always the same reaction--Good, good god, it's good. "
"Heady Topper","You had this beer. "
"Heady Topper","Have had this plenty of times in a can and in a glass."
"Heady Topper","Poured (partially) from a 16-oz. tallboy can into a tulip-shaped Relic Brewing Co. Belgian snifter."
"Heady Topper","You had this beer. "
"Heady Topper","Well I am following the instructions and drinking this one from the can. I did previously have one poured into a glass.... which the apperance is hazy gold with hop leaves floating around and white sticky head. Sicne I'm reviewing this from the can, I will be generous with appearance since the can has a pretty cool look. The aroma is bright and citrusy with loads of apricot, grapefruit, lemon zest, and pine. The aroma emanates freely from the mouth opening which gives me a nice bit of aroma (which I was expecting to be restrained from the can). The taste is delicious... the hops all come together and features a nice fruity/citrus profile. Notes of mango, apricot, and grapefruit come through with minimal bitterness. A touch of cream even comes through which really unifies the flavors. Almost no bitterness on the finish. The 8% ABV is dangerously undetectable. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonation which makes for a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a delicious IPA. I recently had a less than fresh can...and I must say the fresh can really shines and pops with flavor. Well worth seeking out."
"Heady Topper","BA share, DenverBeerDrinker (thanks man!)"
"Heady Topper","Finally get to do a full review of this. I did pour it out of the can however. Body is cloudy and some brown/orange in the amber. Head is maybe a finger tall any only slightly off-white. Smells amazing like citra hops. There is a sweetness to it, but that blends in so well with the hops that you almost miss it. Lime and grapefruit. For flavor, it is very similar to the aroma. Nice lime and pine. A little white sugar. Mouth is great with strong carbonation and decent body. "
"Heady Topper","Can poured into tulip."
"Heady Topper","S: Huge blast of peach, citrus, passionfruit. Unbelievably fruity and bright, faint maltiness."
"Heady Topper","So after a few years, I wanted to give this beer the full review it deserves. "
"Heady Topper","Can from unknown production date:"
"Heady Topper","First of all this is my favorite beer definitively. Its in the top 5 best things about living in Vermont for me (I still lovermont) so take this review with a grain of salt if you must "
"Heady Topper","A- Cloudy and ugly peach colored body with tons of floaters. Head is a big frothy white color that leaves a ton of lacing. It makes sense that they want you to drink this out of a can."
"Heady Topper","You had this beer. "
"Heady Topper","Appearance – Drank straight from the can. "
"Heady Topper","A - Cloudy and overall not a deterrent but it is cloudy. It depends on your expectation for a great IPA. Pliny is clear, heady is cloudy. So what. What do you want"
"Heady Topper","This it it! Years of tasting beers and I've found my favorite (thus far). Everything about this beer suits my palate perfectly. Arena, bitterness, yeast character are all flawless. Its unique yeast, plentiful hops, and generous bittering are perfect."
"Heady Topper","This beer is a hazy orange with a nice fluffy head and excellent lacing. It does kind of look like there's dandruff in there, though (can says it's hop resins). "
"Heady Topper","Went to the brewery to get this one, only to find they had sold out. Luckily a local pub had it on tap and all the travelling was well worth it. Appearance wise it is cloudy with a grainy foamy head. Not overly pretty but i know this is meant to be drunk straight out of a can, so i wont hold that against them. Hops hit the nose straight away in a big american way, citrusy, piney, tropical, but underneath it all is a reasuring earthy malt base. Tastes a lot like it smells. A bunch of wonderful things coming together in a way that isnt completely cohesive, but complimentary enough that you can enjoy everything together or pick out the various delicious elements, like a farmers market salad. Really, really like this. its got a nice oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation and finishes clean and moreish. taste well rounded, complete, refreshing a little raw, but in a surprisingly endearing way. Would drink a lot of these, but i dont live in Vermont so i can't."
"Heady Topper","Thank you so much to Jzeilinger for sending me this in return for absolutely nothing. You sir are truly awesome!"
"Heady Topper","I am reviewing based on a 16oz can poured into a pint glass. I regularly drink this right from the can but made the pour for purpose of this review. I've had it on tap as well."
"Heady Topper","Very hazy amber color, dirty juice look with a lot of particulate, with just over one finger of head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Surprising lack of lacing is left down the glass. The beer is nothing great to look at."
"Heady Topper","Pours hazy gold into a Sam glass. Bright white head with excellent retention recedes to coat surface. Tropical fruit and grapefruit aromas. Full with sweet tropical fruit upfront turning to full resin and grapefruit in the lasting finish. Truly a wonderful ale from a great up and coming brewery."
"Heady Topper","You had this beer. "
"Heady Topper","Finally, I got my hands on this. Here we go. I'm going to drink from the can, as instructed on the can, but I will pour a bit so I can comment on the appearance. Aromas on popping the can are strong and abundant. Beautifully balanced oregano-spiced hops roll out, with a strong resiny background and malty sweet backbone. Smells amazing. I poured about a half a tumbler so I could see any head formation, and boy is there. The beer is a slightly hazed, unfiltered, goldenrod coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head that is an inch and a half and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Flavors are roasted in the backbone, with a rich, resiny, bitter hops presence that just overflows the palate. The hops spicing is more subtle than the nose was, which works out very well in the total package. Citrus characters roll out across the palate the more you drink, with an undertone of grapefruit tart and bitterness. Delicious. Wet hops flavors are abundant from the initial taste across the board into the aftertaste. Rich, full bodied, and extremely smooth, which supports all of the flavor profiles. The finish is bitter and slightly drying, with a clean overall feel. This beer is fantastic. The more you drink, the more layers of hops flavor reveal themselves. Amazing. This is a tremendous brew!"
"Heady Topper","On tap in a snifter at the cannery in Vermont."
"Heady Topper","Oh man was I glad to score one of these! I poured a little into a glass to see what it looked like; nothing special but you're supposed to drink it out of the can so..not applicable?"
"Heady Topper","16 ounce pint can thanks to youbrewidrink, appreciate it man! Pour is bright orange with a lot of haze, some floaties, and a lot of lacing. Smell is fruity hops, some pine, smells good. Flavor is bitter, tropical fruits, definitely a good DIPA. If I didn't know better I'd guess this was a west coast IPA. I can see why this is so highly rated and I'd love to get a four pack but I know it isn't easy."
"Heady Topper","Looks like dirty sewer water dumped into a light beer, smaller off white head. Aroma is tropical fruit, marijuana, onions. Similar flavor, lots of onions, garlic, tomato, juicy fruit, papaya, and orange. Bitter finish, pretty dry for the ABV. Reminds me exactly of what Toppling Goliath is doing around here."
"Heady Topper","Alchemist Heady Topper is a delicious DIPA. It has the delicious aroma and flavour of hops without being particularly bitter. How did they do that? I want to know so I can homebrew some."
"Heady Topper","On a Trip to Vermont with the Family... I had to stop here. I got my first taste of this beer on Tap and it was amazing. Of course they were out of cans, luckily on my way out of town they were restocked and I picked up some (definitely not enough)."
"Heady Topper","A fresh specimen canned on Monday October 8. We quickly developed an intimate rapport with this beer."
"Heady Topper","A - I followed directions and drank it straight out of the the can. Cool can."
"Heady Topper","Special thanks to Andrew84 for this one "
"Heady Topper","I tried this from the can and poured. As the can advises, the taste is better from the can. Poured it is hazy orange, very little head and minimal lacing."
"Heady Topper","A - Pours a very hazy orange/yellow with nice 2 finger white head. I love the haziness here, almost pumpkin colored in tint."
"Heady Topper","Been trying to track this one down for a long while, finally scored a solo can. Enjoying from the Can as the can instructs you to. This is my first review."
"Heady Topper","I followed the directions and drank it straight from the can- each time you take a sip the hops (citra?) really hits you! "
"Heady Topper","I've had this beer many, many times..On tap at the PIG is the best place to drink it. Also, had it straight up out of the can. And, even went against the grain and poured the can into a glass pint. This beer is so god i would recommend taking a bath in it. Tons of hop after hop his your noise from the get go. Beautiful gold color, with a creamy head that laces perfectly to the glass and your face! Mild bitter, Erich is explained on the can. 8% abv so clearly, this one can get ahead of you. Very balanced malt to bittering, creating a nice full creamy body. I live about 3hrs away from the Alchemist cannery, and do travel up there often, if, you're looking to trade, drop me you're request."
"Heady Topper","Picked up quite a few 4 packs from the Hunger Mountain Co-op on my way to the HF Harvest Festival"
"Heady Topper","Saved my first review for my favorite beer I've ever had. Thank you grandparents for residing in Vermont and giving me an excuse to load up on Heady once a year."
"Heady Topper","A big shout out to Verecund for this one! Very awesome of you man!"
"Heady Topper","5/13/2013 - Snifter. I was told this was ""4 days old"" from the kind bearded man who apparently had a trunk full of this bounty."
"Heady Topper","Can thanks to juliusseizure. Enjoyed from the can, because my mother taught me to follow directions."
"Heady Topper","What a fun can of beer! It is great that we can zip up to Vermont and bring a couple of cases home for sharing over the summer. Of course, the warning ""drink from the can"" does make a difference. I did pour some in a snifter, but you lose some of the smell and the creaminess."
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a hazy dark straw yellow in color with some hints of golden yellow and very light amounts of visible carbonation. The beer has a finger tall dense and creamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a mottled thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed."
"Heady Topper","(Notes from an April 2012 sampling)"
"Heady Topper","Reasonably fresh can, as fresh as I can get them in Europe. Thank you PaulMcConnell, been dying to try this hype monster since I first heard of it. Canned September 5th, had September 23rd. Poured a small amount into a glass for the appearance."
"Heady Topper","I get this from time to time, it was the best beer i ever had about three years ago. But lately, something has changed not worth the 3 hour drive each way anymore, not to mention the bullshit of store hopping if you want more than a 4pk."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can to a nonic pint"
"Heady Topper","A-I drink from the can but have poured into a glass and it is an amber with tons of sediment. "
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Heady Topper pours a hazy pale orange color and is topped with ¾” of head that tends to linger nicely, while Belgian lacing lines the glass. "
"Heady Topper","Although the can directs not pour I couldn't do that. After taking a sip or two from the can I poured out and got the full hop aroma which I have to have with an IPA. This is beer is talked up so much I feared I would be let down but even with lofty expectations this beer exceeded them. Best IPA in northeast, Hands down."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: His mama name him 'Clay', I'ma call him 'Clay' - straight from the can as advised by the maker. Who am I to defy him?"
"Heady Topper","Had my first Heady Topper from the can..this ones from a tulip. Pours a very hazy pale orange with 2 fingers of head. Great retention and lacing. Some bubbles rising in the glass."
"Heady Topper","Cracked open a can over the weekend...had it before but just getting around to reviewing it. The can I received from a friend is a couple weeks ""old"" but apparently at prime drinking age. "
"Heady Topper","Finally getting around to reviewing this one after drinking it several times and learning that I really love it. Poured at fridge temp into an opaque ceramic mug. Peering down in there, it looks like a good murky orange color, and I vaguely recall that it looks good in a glass."
"Heady Topper","Pick up as much as you can when visiting the Brewery in Vermont! "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to a great friend Tut2528 for giving me my first HT! Really appreciate it my man!"
"Heady Topper","Last of a four can haul. Pours peach-juice amber. Big white head with slippery spots of lacings on the glass (yeah, I ignored the can instructions). "
"Heady Topper","Drank out of the can. This is about as close to DIPA perfection as you can get. I absolutely cannot believe that beer from a can could be this good. Total fresh hop fragrance hits you as you pop the top of the can. The can says ""drink from the can"" but I need to pour it into a glass to appreciate the hop aroma and flavor to its fullest. really nice unfiltered murky pour with a huge off-white creamy head. The flavor is perfection: huge hop flavor with none of the bitterness. My favorite beer right now."
"Heady Topper","Whenever I make my way to Hill Farmstead, I always make sure to drop by and pick up a few Heady's, which says something because it is one of a few IPAs that can stand up to the HF IPAs. "
"Heady Topper","A- Pours a honey gold, with a great head, slighly cloudy with sediment which is why it's 4.5 and not a 5. The floaties in there are a great part of this beer however. The Hop oils are apparent."
"Heady Topper",(can)
"Heady Topper","murky orange pour - had 2 cans, drinking this one from a glass because i can.. fuck you :) ... half inch of off-white head, thick lacing."
"Heady Topper","Can shared by Mike. Thanks! Pours dark golden with off white head. Aroma is sick. And by that I mean awesome. Wet resiny sticky hops dominate the nose. Flavor follows the nose and has a great meaty malt backbone to back it up. Medium mouthfeel. This tastes amazing. Its worthy of all the praise it gets. Just awesome."
"Heady Topper","Pours very cloudy light orange with a huge 2 finger foamy snow white head that was full of bubbles and faded slowly, leaving very good foamy lacing. "
"Heady Topper","WOW! This is an exceptionally well hopped pale ale. I wish I could get it all the time. It is cloudy orange with a finger of head. Highly carbonated with a full complement of hop aromatics. Lower bitterness than I was expecting from a imperial IPA. WOW!"
"Heady Topper","Had two glasses of this on my birthday. If this even wasn't in the afternoon and I didn't have to drive myself home I'd have had quite a few more."
"Heady Topper","Thanks ZGunder you made my week with these heady toppers!"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks goes out to YaKnowBrady for sending me a few cans of this for the sole reason that I had never ticked it before! Thanks immensely my friend! Served from can into an oversized wine glass. Poured red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, fruit, and fruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, onion hop, earth, and fruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. I am so excited I was finally able to try this one now that they can it. Wow! What a beer it was… It had some aspects that reminded me of Gubna, but had a huge amount of balance going on to keep your palate nice and happy so it did not succumb to a palate hop onslaught. Very well balanced and inviting after each sip. You know what… Notre Dame is playing Navy right now as I’m typing this up on my laptop, I think I will have another one of these right now straight from the can! Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Can shared on the bus during RBSG 2012. Pours clear gold with a sudsy white head. Huge tropical and citrus aroma, grapefruit, peach, orange peel, pineapple. Nice blend of resin, pine and acidic citrus notes in the flavor. Dry bitter finish. Great DIPA, promoting big hoppy flavors instead of malt and booze."
"Heady Topper","a: Pale gold to deep gold in color, with a significant, long lasting head. A small amount of carbonation and a bit of lacing."
"Heady Topper","A - Pours wonderfully in my goblet style glass. Nice, 2 finger white head. Amber golden in color & very cloudy. "
"Heady Topper","Poured into my Great Lakes snifter (against the advice of the can cuz I'm a badass)"
"Heady Topper","My deepest thanks go out to Urbancaver. Because of his thoughtfulness and good nature, I was given the rare opportunity to try this beer. I'm told it's about 5 days old at the time of this review."
"Heady Topper","A - Pours a hazy orange, sunset with snowflake particles swimming around. A big 3"" froth comes after the pour and stays around like your annoying uncle on the holidays. "
"Heady Topper","an affordable can at farmhouse tap in burlington. they say drink it from the can, but i poured it for more careful study. it looks lovely, hazy, definitely unfiltered. radiant hay color with thick white suds floating on top that leave some mean lacing as it drinks. smells like quite the hop bouquet. grapefruit and spruce are the most prominent hop esters im picking up, but there are many. it tastes like it smells, deep and complex, worthy of patient consumption. its fruity, in addition to citrus there is also nectarine and mandarin orange on my tongue. its got upbeat carbonation which keeps its oily medium taffy sticky body moving along. the aftertaste is long and bittersweet, as it should be. alcohol is well hidden in taste, but can certainly be felt. this is one hell of a big ipa, and i dont want to hear anymore debate about pliny/heady, because both are outstanding and distinct brews, and that should suffice for all of us."
"Heady Topper","16 0z can was poured into a tulip glass. I have had it out of the can plenty of times and respect the brewery to drink it out of the can except for this one time."
"Heady Topper","Tasted and smelled from the can as per the directions. Poured for a appearance afterwards."
"Heady Topper","Big Thanks to MarkF150. Believe this was canned 8/9"
"Heady Topper","In my top 3 all time favorite beers. FIghts for the number 1 spot But I think it might be one of the ebst beers"
"Heady Topper","I was able to buy a couple 4-packs of this cult legend during a recent trip to Stowe, Vermont. No buyer's remorse at all! I enjoyed Heady straight from the can–as recommended by the brewery right on the can–but I did have a single serving decanted into a wine glass (I do prefer drinking it straight from the can). "
"Heady Topper","Yes I have enjoyed it straight from the can, but today I am reviewing in a glass."
"Heady Topper","My buddy went up to Vermont this past month and was lucky enough to pick up a 6pack for himself and gave me one!"
"Heady Topper","You had this beer. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Rob for acquiring this one. Really cool can, by the way, although I didn't heed the advice to drink from it."
"Heady Topper","A - An awesome can - Drink from it."
"Heady Topper","A - An orange, almost amber color. Quite cloudy. Limited carbonation. "
"Heady Topper","Between the Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, and Lawson's Finest, I feel very lucky to live in VT! IPAs are my favorite style of beer, but I usually find DIPAs to be too strongly tasting of alcohol. This beer is incredibly smooth and drinkable despite its high alcohol content and potent hopping. The smell of the heady topper alone is delicious, and the taste is even better, with passionfruit, mango, and piney hop aromas. The heady topper delivers the ultimate hops experience!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into a Sam Adams nucleation glass. Thanks DonFrap for including it in the last trade."
"Heady Topper","Drank from my Gulden Draak tulip."
"Heady Topper","Two cans, one poured, the other straight up. Poured has a nice white head, no lacing. The smell is piney and flowery. The taste is totally raw and bitter, sweet upfront and that's the end, except for a chalky dry aftertaste. It's greasy with a good amount of fizz. Why is a beer like this necessary?"
"Heady Topper","thank you."
"Heady Topper","scored a couple 4-packs and smuggled them back to PA. pint can into flying dog tulip. no canned on date. "
"Heady Topper","This is incredible stuff, this beer was drank mostly from the can... only poured a sample of it out to enjoy the orange yellow color of it with a nice looking white head on top. Had a nice unfiltered cloudiness to it also. The smell of the beer is very hoppy, lots of pine aromas in it with the delicate floral and citrusy notes in there as well. The taste is probably worthy of a 5.5 honestly. There is no doubt that this has some of the best transitions of flavors I've had from any IPA. There is a huge rush of floral sweet citrus notes on the tongue in the very beginning, as the liquid settles there is a very subtle burst of malts on the tongue right before the aggressive pine resin starts to claw away at your taste buds. The mouthfeel is smoothly carbonated making this beer very easy to drink, it's medium bodied and has a nice dry finish to it. Overall this is something very special, The people up at Alchemist aren't screwing around here, they are setting out to make the best IPA in the world and I would say that they just might have it. This is a beer I would drive to Vermont to get cases of. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to drinking the next 3 in the pack."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to a great friend for sharing with me."
"Heady Topper","A: golden straw colored with a light eggshell colored head"
"Heady Topper","I got no bad words about it. But this is theee best beer that I ever drink in my holler life of travelling the world. And I have to say that the alchemist brewery did an exceptional job on this unique beer. For those that can handle the heady topper, maybe you should try the walden. That is a brew made by the alchemist and hill farm brewery together. Very similar to heady topper but much lite. I wish the alchemist made more then 1800 cans of week so that other stores closer to my house would be able to have them."
"Heady Topper","Sorry, I had to pour into the glass despite the can's pleading to drink directly. Thick, slowly receding head. Leaves plenty of chunky, blanketing lace. Cloudy, dark gold color."
"Heady Topper","As instructed, I drank this AMAZING beer directly from the can as well as from a tulip glass. Hands-down, no-doubt one of my Top 3 IPAs of all-time..."
"Heady Topper","Yesterday, HT was a beer I hoped to try some day. Today, after a tasting, HT is the best beer I've ever had. Thanks to Brandon for sharing a 4-pack, of which I greedily and surreptitiously consumed more than my fair share. "
"Heady Topper","What a beer!!!"
"Heady Topper","Reviewed as drank from the can, as it is made abundantly clear that this is the way to drink it. "
"Heady Topper","Had on Tap at the Blind Tiger some months back... from notes"
"Heady Topper","This beer was kind of hard to review. The can is stamped all over with ""Drink from can"" so that is how I had it. Very hard to rate appearance with a beer in a can. So, I'll give it a 4.0, assuming from the rest of the characteristics that it would look good in a glass."
"Heady Topper","App: well, it says right on the can to drink it from the can! So I did. But for review sake, I poured half of it in a glass to look at it. Appears pale yellow, light orange, cloudy, low carbonation, slight lacing, the way I envision an IPA, like it should be, not deep orange."
"Heady Topper","My first review of a beer I choose this one, kindly sent fresh from the northeast. I preface, this offering is being tasted on an afternoon where, sometime following this review i will be trying my first Pliny TE (having arrived simultaneously).. Heady Topper: As a lover of American craft brew for 3 years and having tried, in my mind, a good deal of DIPA's (considering I didn't become a craft beer advocate until relocating to Texas oddly enough), I am more than enthusiastic about this tasting.The hop bouquet is blowing my mind, and in a well-balanced way. Expectations of this beer are met and slightly exceeded (they were phenomenal expectations prior to sampling). Pineapple/ citrusy greatness abounds. With this beer it seems as if I've never appreciated the mouthfeel of this style until now. There is no drawback here. Tasty beyond belief. Balance is impeccable, yet i need to stress how the hops flourish here... is this Simcoe and Citra? Well i dont know, that I wonder though. Anyway out of curiosity I poured a bit less than 1/4 of the can into a Chimay chalice for a visual. I really appreciate an unfiltered IPA made well (prior to this my affinity was for the now-shelved DFH Squall). Im liking the look of murky golden when I know everything else about it is sublime. The lacing with Heady is incredible, and again lacing is something I continue to appreciate but with this beer in a glass it was sticky city (and this from a beerman who spot cleans his glassware well). But yes I have to agree with the brewmastery of Alchemist where the recommendation is to drink from the can. Yes you will surely love it in glassware, but if you love true hop heaven, you will be best to press lips to aluminum."
"Heady Topper","Thanks cam!!!!"
"Heady Topper","You had this beer. "
"Heady Topper","I had heard alot about Alchemist in the beer world and had yet to try any of their beers. The other day I was in Waterburry and decided to find their brewery. Apparently the brew pub was flooded badly during hurricane Irene along with the rest of Waterburry. Luckilly their new 15 barrel canning brewery was not damaged and now produces Heady topper exclusively. I went into their store and they were selling Heady Topper for $12 a 4-pack as well as a Glutein-free saison, but I was only interested in the Heady Topper, which is fairly hard to get a hold of unless you are in the Waterburry/Burlington area of Vermont. I live in north eastern Vermont and I hadn't seen it around, but have heard it can cost alot more than $3 a can in some gas stations. "
"Heady Topper","Had on Tap at the Blind Tiger some months back... from notes"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Celtic001 for a couple of these sent my way. I was so excited for the arrival of these, that once they were chilled to perfection, they disappeared quickly. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a murky dark orange/gold with a thick lustrous off-white head on top. "
"Heady Topper","Let me tell you about the mythical adventure that this beer bestowed upon me...."
"Heady Topper","A friend of mine gave this beer to me as a belated birthday present and I was a bit surprised that it came in the form of a can but don't let the can intimidate you."
"Heady Topper","Pours from a 16 oz can, nice hazy orange color. Smell is of sweet hops. Taste is medium bodied, great balance to it. Not overly hoppy (as warned by the outside of the can) and has a great maltiness to it that most IPAs (specifically double IPAs) are missing. Delicious aftertaste.. I can see why this has such a high rating. Felt lucky to try this beer, definitely worth seeking out if you get a chance.. one of the better imperial IPAs I've gotten to try."
"Heady Topper","What more can I say about this beer? Drove 7 hrs from PA to the brewery. People were very nice there. Bought 3 cases, only trouble is you have to keep it cold because it is unpasturized I believe."
"Heady Topper","I got this beer from a fellow advocate beerMeFitz, thanks man! Following the advice of a friend, I poured some in my Half Acre Tulip and drank the rest in the can. The pour was a hazy beautiful orange color with very little head that disappeared rather quickly. I Swirled it around in the glass a little and noticed that the lacing was not as much as I expected."
"Heady Topper","The verbiage on the can states that you should drink this right out of the can. Sacrilege to most beer geeks, but the request comes from the brewers and I understand why. I tasted this out of a snifter since it was being shared with a really good beer guy I met at the Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell. He brought a few cans in with him and he was sharing, so I was gratefully drinking. "
"Heady Topper","Despite the ""directions"" I've been conditioned to only drink BMC out of the can. Dark orange-yellow in color, looks like dirty orange juice, and murky. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a sturdy white cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass.. Pungent citrus pineapple aroma with solid sweet, sticky malt and orange beneath and just the slightest hint of booze. The aroma almost has a feel to it. Like hop resin and dust in the sinuses. Amazing. Thick and chewy feel with dense, rich carbonation that lazily rolls through. Pungent citrus hop flavor from start to finish that are propped up by a strong sweet malty backbone.. Finishes with a lingering pine hop bitterness with a touch of citrus bitterness and booze."
"Heady Topper","I just opened my first ever Heady Topper. In the words of the great Homer Simpson ""Jebus, Buddha, I love you alll."" This is different than anything I have had before. Nothing relates to it. I have had Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, and a number of other amazing beers. I am not sure I am saying its the best beer I have ever had, but its in the discussion and its definitely unique. I am drinking it straight from the can as the rim of the can says to do. Its extremely bitter to in the begining but citrus in the end. Do whatever it takes to get your hands on this (outside of taking one of my glorious new friends from my fridge)."
"Heady Topper","No question the best IPA I've had. Can not review appearance, you should only drink from the can, as designed. (But gave it a 5 because I'm sure it's perfect, website makes you enter value here) Desperate to find more, may have to take a trek... Grab this if you can, beats them all."
"Heady Topper","Fresh can given to me by Beermefitz, a complete stranger until today. Thank you so much for the generous gesture. Good beer karma shines down on you this day."
"Heady Topper","A: Perfect... clear golden with a thick lasting white head."
"Heady Topper","Pint-sized can served cold."
"Heady Topper","This is the shiznit. Been drinking and home brewing for years. DIPA's are my thing and this is amazing. Best beer on the east coast IMHO and probably the best beer I've had. I lived on the west coast 15 years ago but haven't had the west coast stuff fresh in years but this stuff is amazing. $4 for a can is a steal. Planning another trip to VT just to stock up. I ruined myself."
"Heady Topper","Following the rules is really difficult for me but when the can tells you to drink it straight from the can, I listen. Hey, who am I to go against the way this beer was meant to be drank. I have heard from others though that this beer isn't very pretty. I can imagine that's true since this thing is truly hop heaven. "
"Heady Topper","500ml can 8,0% ABV. "
"Heady Topper","Bought a 4-pack from the Beverage Warehouse while in Winooski last weekend."
"Heady Topper","A - I know it says to drink from the can but I wanted to see it. It's a hazy, orange with hints of lemon near the edges. Light carbonation near the bottom. Had a few inches of white head that slowly disappeared "
"Heady Topper","I did not go into this with too big of expectations. Most of the highly rated IPAs I've had have not lived up to my expecations and I was disappointed. Maybe going into it with open expectations is the way to go, because this floored me. I am so sad it is gone. "
"Heady Topper","16oz can divided between a snifter and the can."
"Heady Topper","Served in a nonical pint glass just for appearance. Drank 1st from the can, the way it is meant to be drank."
"Heady Topper","A - pours a slightly hazey marigold color. A fingers worth of froathy white head which quickly dissipates to just a white ring around the rim. No lacing. "
"Heady Topper","thanks to egrace84 for sending this can my way! Thanks elliot!"
"Heady Topper","The Crack! seemed extra loud in the silence of my kitchen following yesterday's snowfall. My gentle Glug still produced a finger of fizzy, bone-white head that turned to wisps pretty quickly. Color was a hazy Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose had a grapefruit tartness underlain by a tropical fruitiness. Mouthfeel was medium. The intensity of the hops immediately began an assault on my tongue, eroding all of those weak or dead taste buds and leaving the defenses wide open for the second wave. Now, it was like hydrofluoric acid, worming its way into every pore and burning like hell. Finish was super hoppy, very dry."
"Heady Topper","1pt Can. A drop into a ½ glass –just for appearance & smelling- the rest direct from the can following brewer´s suggestion. Enjoyed on jun´12. Pale straw color, hazy. Off-white, small bubbled, froth. Slowly dissipated crown leaves a thin foam layer on top. Intense ripe tropical fruit, resin & sweet malt aromas. Pleasant sweet, creamy, maltiness at fist sip mixed with tropical fruits & increasing bitterness. Medium to full body, oily texture. Low carbonation. Ripe fruit in the middle cut by resiny touch lingers into the short, dry finish. Delightful. Probably one of the best AIPA I´ve ever had."
"Heady Topper","I was at one of my favorite beer stores when I heard that they had a case of Heady Topper in the back. I decided to pick two up to see what all the buzz was about. Brought these devils home and put them on ice for a rainy day. 8 hours later I decided it was close enough. "
"Heady Topper","This, indeed, lives up to expectations. Grabbed 24 cans in VT while boating on champlain lake. Also got some torpedo, founder's centennial and ruination IPA from stone, but HT is way more interesting. First one was pretty good. The 2 lasts were just delicious."
"Heady Topper","Wow! I received a four pack as a gift this weekend. Had heard about the beer before but put it in the fridge and continued the night. Had two last night and one tonight. What an amazing beer. Every aspect of this beer- down to the clear instructions to drink it straight from the can (cant truly rate the appearance because I drank em from the can)- make it a very special beer. After having three and checking the reviews I was not surprised to see that it is so highly rated."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to my buddy for bringing two cans of Heady Topper to our college reunion. "
"Heady Topper","I drank the first sips from the can. Wowza! That's some insane hoppiness. As a force of habit, I had to pour 3/4 into a pint glass. The pour revealed a hazy golden blonde liquid topped with a big bubbled, chunky head. A few chunks of lace cling to the glass and the head recedes a bit but never disappears. A dusting of coarse sediment lays at the bottom. I'd suggest putting this beer in a glass if only because it looks so nice. "
"Heady Topper","Oh, how I tried not to love this beer..."
"Heady Topper","Nice loose and tall head over a straw colored body."
"Heady Topper","purchased on ebay, and after arriving i quickly purchased again! "
"Heady Topper","A=4: Hazy gold with plenty of yeast floaties, nice white head with plenty of retention, some lacing."
"Heady Topper","Pounded my first HT on my break at work today in fifteen minutes since it was consume on premises only so this review might be a little muddled, but hey, at least I got some Head."
"Heady Topper","There's quite a lot of hype surrounding this beer, and it is my favorite style, so I was very excited to finally be able to pick some up while in Vermont recently. I drank my first one last night from the can like it says, but this time I'm pouring a whole can into a 16 oz Sam Adams ""Perfect Pint"" glass for the review (and yes I will drink the remaining two from the can!)"
"Heady Topper","Purchased a can from the Warren Store "
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from the can as instructed."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Mielbeer for these 4 cans!"
"Heady Topper","The word delicious sums up this beer quite well!"
"Heady Topper","16oz can, with no canning date, $17.99/4-pack at Andover liquors."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to merc7186 for picking up a few cans of this for me..."
"Heady Topper","Served from can."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can. Drank straight from the can. no freshness dating. thanks to markasparov for this one. "
"Heady Topper","A: Apricot hue with a thin head and a good amount of lacing; some sediment floating around, which is why I suppose they want you to drink it from the can--sorry, guys, I just can't do it"
"Heady Topper","Thanks Hoppypocket for the opportunity to try this bad-boy!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can into Harpoon Limited Edition snifter."
"Heady Topper","This is my second time having this super hyped up beer. Both times I really enjoyed it. This time I am reviewing and only poured 5 ounces out of can to see appearance and get more smell than outta can...not that you can't smell the hops as soon as you crack the can. Really hazy yellowish with minimal head. Laces but not as sticky as I was anticipating, dissipates as the head did. This beer you can smell as your drinking it, rinds, grapefruit,citrus, and don't forget the hops. Different than any dipa that I ever had. Great hop pop, Med Carb,and balance that makes you want more!! Big hop aftertaste that keeps you wanting more. Overall lives up to hype and will seek out again. Hop heads dream and really really leaves hops for days in your mouth. In my top 5 just unsure until I have access to more where it falls."
"Heady Topper","My girlfriend's brother brought us a 4 pack straight from the source. I gave it all 5s for a reason."
"Heady Topper","I decided to go for this long awaited treat from The Alchemist for my 200th review."
"Heady Topper","Light in color sort of a amber straw, nice white head and good aroma, not as much aroma as I would have expected, but good citrus and flower comes through. Also drank out of the can as suggested. The taste is nice and smooth, great drinkability. Maybe not as well balanced as others, the bitterness seems to linger with this one and I think it tends to take over the thin malt base. Great beer overall, but needs a bit better balance."
"Heady Topper","I've had this beer in a pint glass from the can and directly out of the can (as the label suggests). Liked it better in the glass. It is by far one of the finest beers I've ever had. Excellent pour brilliant finish. Place it up there with Pliney the Elder."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Joe for breaking this out and sharing."
"Heady Topper","My first can of Heady Topper. A clean snifter glass ready-to-go, but I promise I’ll take that first sip from the can."
"Heady Topper","Many thanks to woodychandler for coming through big time with this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has an orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is alive with hops and citrus. Taste is also very good, hoppy, citrus and tropical fruits abound, bitter but not overly so, a well constructed beer. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall was a pleasure to drink, worth seeking out."
"Heady Topper","A - Wow they were right about one thing if you pour the can it's full of tons of hop floaties. Color is a hazy amber brown with a 1/2 inch of thick bubbly head. "
"Heady Topper","16oz can into Duvel tulip (drank small amount from the can--prefer it in the glass, *as with every beer*). No freshness info, but my friend just bought it for me when a stray case hit Boston a couple days ago. Sold out in a day at 1 can per customer."
"Heady Topper","Amazing. by far my fav ipa. Drank a Pliny the elder and heady topper side by side and hands down heady topper came out on top just amazing. Once you crack the can you get an abundance of fresh grapefruit. Usally I drink straight from the can as it indicates to do. But not bad in a snifter as well. So well balanced. All I can think of when drinking this ipa is a super fresh grapefruit coated with a tad of granulated sugar. Hands down perfection."
"Heady Topper","A - Hazy pale orange with all sorts of floaties in it but who cares? "
"Heady Topper","Thanks merc for sharing this, super stoked to try this."
"Heady Topper","Pours a golden with nice haze. Head is minimal, even for the style. A pinch of lacing"
"Heady Topper","After having this beer many times I figured it's finally time to review it."
"Heady Topper","Drank a few swigs from the can then poured into a snifter (I know, a sin). Can't verify freshness."
"Heady Topper","Courtesy of the Black Sheep Ale House in Mineola, NY."
"Heady Topper","A: dirty orange/cloudy, finger white head, "
"Heady Topper","This is the one and only. No clue how old, but definitely my most anticipated beer I got from phyl21ca in CanBIF 2012. Took a sniff and a mouthful from the can as directed, then poured into a tulip. "
"Heady Topper","had this beer many times both from the can and poured out into a glass. I really hope I can get the chance to try this brew on tap (if they do that). I have to be honest, I love the smell you get when you pour the beer into a glass and the color is spectacular, however I like the taste better straight out of the can. I wish their was a happy medium that could be found. So poured out of the can it is a golden copper color with a nice cream colored head. The smell is floral hops and very inviting. The taste is very crisp and hoppy but not overpowering. I love how balanced this IPA is."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to ActonBrewer for this one. Reviewed from notes. Drank from the can (as instructed)."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into an oversized, high stemmed, red wine/goblet glass."
"Heady Topper","Paid almost $13 for a single can of this beer. Worth it? We shall see."
"Heady Topper","This is really an amazing beer. I am generally not into double IPA because they usually substitute taste for strength of content. However, I bought a 4 pack of this from Waterbury VT, and I loved it more each time I had it. The hops are incredible, the flavor is ... well try it. Its worth the three bucks that it costs."
"Heady Topper","Poured from the can. An unfiltered cloudy orange/yellowish/bronze color with a light bubbly white head, and yeast particles abound. This beer is not the prettiest thing to look at."
"Heady Topper","Its the real deal. Hoppy, Cirtusy, delicious. Smoothest finishing IPA / DIPA ever. No idea that it packs any extra booze than a smooth IPA. Wish I had more."
"Heady Topper","Can at Deccico's in Brewster - and several since. Poured into tulip. Pours a hazy sticky orange. Smells fantastic. Fruity intense hop aroma! Pineapple and pine. Taste is very hop forward with a bit of fruity sweetness, pineapple, pine bitter, and some nice malt balance. A nice bitter but smooth mouthfeel..."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can, no date, drank most of it out of the can, poured the rest into a snifter. Big thanks to Agold for sharing this with me."
"Heady Topper","Wow! Now I know why this beer has a 100 rating! Popped open my first Heady Topper tonite (am drinking it right now) thanks to a great trade bonus from rudzud (thanks again!) Notes follow:"
"Heady Topper","Heady topper is ridiculously cloudy with a nice head they yields a bit of lacing. There is some beer dandruff floating around as well. Aroma is very fruity and citrus pine explosion. There's a huge pungent aroma, this beer doesn't fuck around. Flavor is Lindy and citrusey. Very nice but not quite as pungent as the aroma and a bit sweeter. The sweetness however does not increase the mouthfeel at all. Light and dry. Very frighteningly drinkable. Definitely happy to have traded for this."
"Heady Topper","look N/A i'm fallowing instructions and not pouring any into a glass"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can (despite the admonishments on the rim) into a Duvel tulip. Courtesy of and split with BA infi, along with BA NYManc."
"Heady Topper","Cumulative review after about 5 in the past 2 weeks..."
"Heady Topper","A: I guess this is the only ""knock"" (what a joke) on this beer. Cloudy with sediment and a lght burnt orange color. It doesn't look that pretty, but I don't want wall art, I want great beer. "
"Heady Topper","A: I know they tell you to drink it out of the can, but that won't get me very far in this section. Pours a dark straw color with a huge white head. Cloudy with some sediment floating around. The price of great flavor."
"Heady Topper","Yet another brew I had, but for some reason didn't rate it right after I had it. Pours a hazy amber color with a big white head and nice lacing. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit hops. Medium body with average carbonation. Excellent citrus hop flavor with a nice malt balance and a nice bitter hop finish. Taste is similar to some west coast DIPAs. Which is not a bad thing! This is Delicious."
"Heady Topper","Served from 16oz can."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to my wife for picking these up for me when she was in VT this past weekend. Drinkin' from the can as is customary. Did pour a little to take a peek, hazy golden in color, dense head which fades away quickly. Pretty dank smell, resinous, pine, and some citrus, it does pop pretty hard. The taste is as expected, hop forward. Snappy, pine, citrus, chewy hops. Then some more hops. Not so bitter, actually much more of a fruity hop affair. This is a little refined for me, I tend to like my IIPAs rough and tough. Leaves the palate dry and crisp finish. Smooth as silk mouthfeel with soft carbonation. No trace of alcohol, drinks as easy as advertised."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: The beer pours a yellowed brown, like cloudy dehydrated piss. With a thick bubbly eggshell white head with good retention. Lacing is light and droopy, only lasting for a short while above the head. "
"Heady Topper","16 oz can generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a very cloudy light amber with a small light tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The aroma is big mango, floral notes, light caramel, a bit of pineapple, and some sugar cookie. The initial taste is sweet with mango and pineapple going into a bit of caramel, sugar cookie, and some light dankness. There is a very light bitterness on finish along with some lingering mango. Light bodied. Low carbonation. I definitely could use a bit more bitterness and a bit less sweetness. Not bad, but certainly not in the class of the best west coast IPAs."
"Heady Topper","A-	As many before me have noted, it screams “DRINK FROM THE CAN!” so the dude abides. I poured a little into a shot glass to get an idea of it though. It’s much lighter in color than I anticipated, close to something like a golden straw color with a small head. The body is cloudy and there are delicious little bits of hops floating about. Don’t read too much into the appearance though. This was by no means a full pour, and I was more curious about the color more than anything else. "
"Heady Topper","A: Straw on edges to orangish gold. Super hazy, not sure if it's from hop haze or unfiltered. Small white head that fades quickly. Some lacing around the edges."
"Heady Topper","Poured only a little bit in to a snifter so i could see the color, the rest will be enjoyed from the can!"
"Heady Topper","S- of heady grapefruit and citrus."
"Heady Topper","Got a couple of these from valdieu! Poured from a 16oz can into a Spiegelau tulip."
"Heady Topper","A-golden amber color with a nice white head and good lacing, hazy with white flaky sediment"
"Heady Topper","A-Poured half into a tulip glass to see the color and drank the other half from the can as instructed by the can itself. The color is a beautiful bright orange/dark yellow. Floating sediments...looks like champagne."
"Heady Topper","Trade from JMRSN. Thanks!"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can. I poured half into a pint glass and drank the other half from the can ala the instructions. Not sure when this was canned, but it comes from the late March release to a few Massachusetts beer shops. "
"Heady Topper","Poured from can into snifter glasses."
"Heady Topper","A: Copper color. Large fluffy white head. Sediment floating."
"Heady Topper","I have had this beer out of the can and out of several glasses and it is always good! I would have to say though, I enjoy it more of it a glass. "
"Heady Topper","16oz can into a tulip"
"Heady Topper","16oz can with sample poured into goblet. From the brewery."
"Heady Topper","Poured a sample in a glass and drank the rest out of the can"
"Heady Topper","Thanks you Kyle for this... man I need more of this for the summer!"
"Heady Topper","Two 16 oz cans (one direct from can, one poured into a glass) courtesy of Kadonny, and poured into my petite Duvel tulip."
"Heady Topper","Several cans, from the can. Aroma is a burst of juicy fruity hops; pinneaples, mangos and oranges. Some wet grass and resinous hops which tends to fade as the beer gets older. Taste: I’d say it is the best tasting double IPA I’ve ever had. Flavors are very coherent with the aroma. Definitly hops at its best. The perfect level of bitterness with a sharp citrus touch. Balance and drinkability is through the roof and alcohol is very well hidden. The ultimate beach beverage"
"Heady Topper","**2015 update with better score. No floaties, better mouthfeel."
"Heady Topper","I can't believe I forgot to review this beer! I grabbed a case when I was in Vermont. Poured into my alchemist pint glass"
"Heady Topper","Welcome to Massachusetts The Alchemist Heady Topper!"
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed from a can with a small glass pour to get a sense of its appearance."
"Heady Topper","Poured from the 16 oz can into a schooner-style glass. Can't come up with one single advantage of drinking from the can...plus I can't review the appearance that way (did take a sip or two from the can in between refilling my glass and it didn't affect the taste at all). No date found anywhere. "
"Heady Topper","It's as good as advertised. Period. If you're lucky enough to find a can, don't pass it up. I could go on and on about the nose, head, color, mouthfeel and finish but everyone else has already said it. In my book, this is the king. It ruined me for other IPAs and until I can find more I'm drinking Sculpin and Deviant Dales."
"Heady Topper","Got in the Master's LIF from Number45forever. Thanks for the awesome beer. Been drinking for the last few days. This is the first review."
"Heady Topper","Not my first go-round with this great beer but my first review of it."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to baconsausage for tossing a couple of these in as extras in a trade."
"Heady Topper","A - Hazy yellow/orange. 2-3 fingers of fluffy white head."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is simply the best Imperial IPA I have ever tasted. Pours out of the can with an aroma of citrus and hops. The unfiltered appearance of this beer works so well with the aroma and adds quite a bit to the experience. The taste is a complex mix of heavy citrus and light hoppy flavor. Very well balanced with a crisp, enjoyable finish. A world class beer out of a can."
"Heady Topper","A: Drank from the can as was suggested by the can."
"Heady Topper","Half a pint poured into tulip. Sampled the rest from the can."
"Heady Topper","Can poured into a 12oz pils glass at the Hulmeville Inn 4/24/2012"
"Heady Topper","A: Poured into an Alchemist Willy glass (Sorry Alechemist, I won't have it from the can again). It pours a cloudy orange with a finger white head. I tried to hold back on the yeast with a gentle pour. "
"Heady Topper","Cloudy golden yellow with a short pale white head. Pale malts, light citrus, fresh and dry hops, lighter fruits grapefruit, pineapple and even tones of peach on the aroma. Fruity and floral from the nose. Rich, smooth fruity and nectar-like hop flavor on the first sip. Rolls into a more floral body with big hits of hops, grapefruit, peaches and dry bitterness. Dry, hoppy, sour finish. Heavily carbonated with a medium body. Intensely impressed with this, easily the best brew I could ever dream of having out of a can."
"Heady Topper","Poured from can into a snifter"
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can, as instructed! (poured a little into a pint glass to get an accurate review. (reviewed from notes) Thanks to TimmyJ21 for this can!"
"Heady Topper","Followed instructions and drank from the can, a first for me with an IPA. As a result, I can't judge the appearance, so I gave it an average. Smell was fantastci, grapefruit and pine and grass; hops galore. Taste was intensely citrus and hops, but no super bitter like most DIPA's. Much of tre hoppiness is on the mouth and tongue, but doesn't so much linger down your throat. The grapefruit, orange, grass, pine flavors are huge and awesome. What a great combination of ingredients!"
"Heady Topper","I drank most of this from the can, but also poured enough of it out to see what it looked like and to see what it's like in the glass. Honestly not sure which I like better. It does seem like the aroma is almost too potent in the glass, making the can a nice step back. "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper pours a very cloudy honey color, hints of orange and soft brown, lots of sediment floating around the glass, much of it sinks to the bottom, a faint head pops up but doesn’t stick around too long, not much of a residual film and some mild soapy lacing sticks to the glass. The aroma is fantastic, big notes of citrus, heavy on the grapefruit, but with a nice amount of tropical fruits, mango, papayas and pineapple come to mind. A healthy amount of grassy and dirtier pine-like hops come through as well, very bitter that cuts the brightness and sweetness very well, almost no malt presence to speak of, some faint biscuit hides in the shadows of huge hoppy aromas. The flavors are wonderful, huge bright notes of citrusy hops, grapefruit, lemon zest, the tropical sweeter flavors are there, some pineapple and mango, but again, a wonderful bitterness from some dry pine and weedy flavors, just a super dank hop profile. Like the aroma, only the faintest biscuity malt can be detected underneath a potent hop forward palate. Nice full body, coats the mouth really well, goes down super easily, remains wonderfully dry and bitter, keeps you coming back without leaving an unpleasant cotton mouth experience. "
"Heady Topper","I've had this enough in a can to be able to appreciate it, but it was nice to have had the opportunity to get it straight from the source and as fresh as possible."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a pint glass. Can split with a friend."
"Heady Topper","A: I did pour a little out to review :) Beautiful, crisp, clear yellow. Thick bright white head. No lacing."
"Heady Topper","I journeyed North into the Green Mountain state to get it, and I would say the trip was well worth it. "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper came out the can looking like a muddy stream but settled in the glass looking reasonably presentable. Its complexion really varies depending on the angle and closeness of the light, ranging from clear straw yellow to thick mango smoothie. Heady does not have much head, nor does it show any signs of carbonation. "
"Heady Topper","Well, somehow PA finally got some fresh Heady Topper directly from The Alchemist via Origlio Beverage. I will say the announcement was made it was coming and it showed up at stores 2 days later. This beer is fresh! So glad to have a chance to drink this liquid gold (know where my review is going??)"
"Heady Topper","finally. a beer that lives up to the hype. "
"Heady Topper","1/2 OF A 16OZ CAN poured into a regular pint glass, while drinking the other half out the CAN. Excited to see this in Philly. I bought it with ease. Purchased a single at Capone's and a 4-pack from the bottle shop at Local 44. Props to Origlio for pulling in a great brewery, it's about time you guys found some new blood."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter"
"Heady Topper","I have been meaning to review Heady Topper for a few weeks now but this seems like as good of a time as any. Thanks to my brother (Mitchell) for going way out of the way to pick up a case while in Vermont. While I will agree with many that Heady will not be winning any awards for appearance, it certainly deserves ever bit of its rating on BA. Heady Topper is definitely one of the best IIPA’s I have ever drank in my life. The hops come in waves and while it never overpowers you it continuously lets you know you are drinking an IIPA. It is scary because it is so drinkable that I could throw back a few of these without hesitation but at 8% is will definitely let you know you have been drinking. It starts off with wave after wave of piney citrus hops in the nose. The hops are present but very drinkable with the same piney citrus mouth feel. This beer is unbelievable as sip after sip coats your mouth with a wave of hops. This beer is definitely better cold as it looses some of the wonderful characteristics as it warms. Follow the instructions on the can and drink it fresh, cold, and from the can and you will not be disappointed!"
"Heady Topper","big ups to OsNJCB for sending this as an extra!"
"Heady Topper","Heard great things about this beer, so when i finally made my way to the brewery i bought an entire case to bring back home because they don't distribute in my area. anyhoo, it was one of the greatest beers I have ever had. What really got me was the aroma, i was practically drinking with my nose. I also love how it comes in a four pack of 16 ounce cans, not a 22 ounce bottle like most of those world class beers. I am definitely making another trip up for some more. The only thing I thought can be a bad thing or good thing i guess is you will have that delicious taste in your mouth for a while. So if you are having any other beer, it may taste like Heady Topper!"
"Heady Topper","16oz can into a tall snifter"
"Heady Topper","1pt can poured into a snifter (sorry, I could not drink this straight out of the can, no matter how much persuasion is written on it.  I have one more and maybe I will.  It just seems wrong though)"
"Heady Topper","FINALLY! Thanks Dave! Pours a hazy/cloudy golden-orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is just what anyone would want in a DIPA...such lovely hop aroma! Tropical hops with intense, bitter pine notes. Smells so fresh and hoppy...pineapple, grapefruit, melon, pine sap, guava, orange, lemon...SO INVITING. Taste is lacking in the malt profile...which is GREAT! Being from the west coast, this is just what I like. A little bit of malt, but not enough to make this delicious brew lose any points. Lovely citrus and tropical fruit flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. No lingering bitterness with this beer...crisp and clean. The palate is miraculously wiped clean after a few seconds of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, full of flavor, and crisp finish. Drinkability is Very High. ABV not even noticeable. Overall, this was a great experience. I am very impressed considering this drinks like a west coast style DIPA...love the lack of malt. I wish I had regular access to this so I could drink it like the can recommends... straight from the can. Brilliant beer!"
"Heady Topper","What needs to be said about this beer that hasn't already? Popped out of a can into my tulip. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to dude from PT"
"Heady Topper","unsure of when it was canned, but it sure smells fresh. part of a trade with gn0sis - thanks! poured into a Deschutes snifter a bit warmer than I needed to (I got home, saw the box, and pulled it straight out instead of giving it any time in the fridge. Couldn't wait!)."
"Heady Topper","Drinking from the can because the can said so. Poured 25cl into a Boulevard tulip so I can judge the appearance and try it from a glass."
"Heady Topper","Served from a can into a tulip. I won't drink from the can, instructions be damed."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to bentwookie for this big want. Tulip glass."
"Heady Topper","Oh my god!!! they really hit this one out the park, smells like citrus, grapefruit,and pine. just had a zombie dust the other day and this one is just as nice of a tasty beer. one is not enough, makes you want to have more and more again. and this all comes from a can WOW."
"Heady Topper","pours a very hazy peach color with loads of sediment floating around and white ring. The nose has a fair bit of citrus and notes of grapefruit. Faint undertone of a sweet caramel malt. The flavor is nice, sweet hops and malts blend together but seems well attenuated. Light grapefruit and bitter citrus round off the dominant hop presence as the bitterness lingers for a moment but doesn't disrupt the drinkability. The body is very inviting with a gentle tingling carbonation and a smooth soft feel to it."
"Heady Topper","Oh wow... so much going on with this special brew... It's such a joy to enjoy... Heaven in a can. The color is a cloudy, deep orange amber; fruity and lively with just the right balance of hoppiness, fruitiness and boldness. And it comes from a CAN!!!"
"Heady Topper","-reviwed from notes-"
"Heady Topper","Well, Heady Topper only being sold locally is both a blessing and a curse... This beer lives up to all the hype. Wave after wave of insanely fresh hops, with absolutely explosive aftertastes. I stick to The Alchemist's recommendation, and drink it straight from the can, so it's tough to comment on appearance, but that's hardly necessary for this big, fresh double IPA. In spite of being a slightly lower ABV than many double IPAs, it packs a bit of a punch, probably because the alcohol is entirely covered up by the hops. Make sure you drink it fresh, and don't fear drinking it out of the can!"
"Heady Topper","BIG thanks to kalvarez for this"
"Heady Topper","From BeerAdvocate magazine Issue #58 (November 2011):"
"Heady Topper","Review #100! Big thanks to Fijii13 for this one. 16 oz. can poured into pint. Decided to ignore the request on the can for reviewing purposes. Had the second straight from the can."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Pours out a hazy, light yellow-orange body strewn with fine particles and topped with a barely off-white head."
"Heady Topper","First shot at trying this. Poured into a plain snifter to judge appearance and aroma. Four pack got in a trade with youbrewidrink."
"Heady Topper","16oz can - thanks to zuma for this"
"Heady Topper","Huge, huge thanks to Jesse (arniepnminne) for hooking me up with this!"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can into my Pretty Things pint glass. Kudos to Erik for bringing this back from VT. I am eager to try it. "
"Heady Topper","A- Deep golden in color, very hazy nice foamy white head that sticks around for awhile a lot of lacing nice looking beer."
"Heady Topper","Out of the can, from multiple fresh deliveries in VT. Thee hops, citrus, pine, and malt come together perfectly. Not the biggest fan of drinking from cans, but it seems thats the brewers preference. Not much booze until it warms up, which makes that 8% catch up with you fast, but the cans also warns you off this. Listen. The can makes it feel like a session beer but it's far for a session beer. Def one of my favorites, but meant to be shared, paired, and part of tastings"
"Heady Topper","Big ups to woodchopper for hooking me up"
"Heady Topper","On draft at Blind Tiger."
"Heady Topper","First - thanks to MRMOJORISIN for bringing cans to our annual ABB-festival."
"Heady Topper","A: Poured a small amount in a glass to see this. Bright golden color with a small white head for as much as I poured. Drank the rest out of the can."
"Heady Topper","Here we go. Taking a shot at reviewing this beast. Had many times before, first review of it."
"Heady Topper","Special thanks to a very kind individual who brought this back from vacation. "
"Heady Topper","A- Chunks and chunks of floating shit in this brew. Looks like a lava lamp, or the Long Island sound during late summer. Nice foamy head at first, fades away and leaves a nice ring of lacing. I have never seen a beer this disgusting to look at. Looks like a bunch of lugees floating in my beer."
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy, light tangerine with a two-finger bright white head. Good lacing and head retention. Aroma, wow. Fresh pineapple, mango, grapefruit and orange and just a touch of pine that is outdone by the huge, fresh fruity notes. This beer is so refreshingly hoppy. Big tropical fruit notes, pineapple is giant. Juciy, fresh grapefruit and orange notes. Nice pine notes add some bitterness too. Hugely hoppy, but with the perfect amount of bitterness. Get different hop notes with each sip and they keep coming. Awesome drinkability, the hop blend goes down like a Gatorade. Overall, the best DIPA I've had to date. Really tough to make this big of a beer this easy to drink while maintaining absolutely huge flavor."
"Heady Topper","Well, I was going to just do a quick ""had"" review. That was until I popped the can open and took a whiff. Whoa man...this is perfection in a tall boy can!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into an imperial pint. But not the whole can. Just a bit of it for appearance testing. Big thanks to BA redbird on this one."
"Heady Topper","Can (thanks Stephen): Poured a cloudy light yellow color ale with large chunks of protein floating around and a large foamy head with good retention. Aroma of super intense pine hops notes with some citrus and resin notes. Taste is also a super intense mix of pine, resin and light citrus undertones hops with a dry malt backbone that is hard to distinguish from the hops attack. The floral aromas are huge end very enjoyable. Body is full with great carbonation. I must admit the hype is totally justified for this one, truly one of the great IIPA."
"Heady Topper","A: A bright tangerine orange is dense with large, bran colored floaties. Dancing yeast cake is evidence of a good swirling carbonation. Frothy cream colored head sits well with a respectable amount of lace. One, I love a ipa that stays true to tradition and stays pale, without the influence of toasted specialty grains. Two, I love the extra visual of dancing yeast floaties, like a snow globe adding not only a visual sense but some vitamins as well."
"Heady Topper","I wish I had poured this out, but my host insisted we drink it from the can. Despite this, it smells full of hops with fantastic nose from THE CAN! Other canned beers (Oscar Blues, Hazed and Infused) can't touch this!"
"Heady Topper","Huge, huge thanks goes out to aasher, one of the best BA's out there for hooking me up with this beer. Not only am I grateful to Al for this can but I'm also grateful for the Surly Darkness snifter I poured a sampled into (the rest being enjoyed from the can per the brewery's guidance). "
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into a pint glass at slightly warmer than fridge temperature."
"Heady Topper","A- Pours an orange color with a fairly thin white head. This beer is pretty ugly with a lot of hop leaf/pellet junks floating around. Head leaves a bit of spotty lacing."
"Heady Topper","Appearance - Pale cloudy body that pours little head. Decent lacing on the small amount that I poured into a glass."
"Heady Topper","Sample: 1 can 2012"
"Heady Topper","16oz can my friend had shipped from a VT hook-up. Served in a snifter. "
"Heady Topper","Pourer from a 16 oz can into a tulip and also drank from the can- poured a hazy light orange color with almost no head very little retention and no lacing."
"Heady Topper","Pours a muddy, opaque light orange with floating sediment. Thin head quickly settles. 4"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to DarthKostrizer for sharing this one at the post Bruery Reserve Society party bottle share!"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to BeRanger for this one."
"Heady Topper","pours cloudy yellow gold with lots of sediment small head faded fast left no lacing"
"Heady Topper","Took the first sip from the can to get the full affect."
"Heady Topper","Canned on Monday drank on Friday. Poured into a glass. "
"Heady Topper","A pale gold with a clumpy, lumpy and rocky foam that sticks and hangs around in amazing ways. "
"Heady Topper","This beer Ive had several times. "
"Heady Topper","So if your beer tastes like this, maybe you only need to make one. There's likely no way that you'll ever out do Heady-Topper so just stop right there!"
"Heady Topper","Holy sweet god. Thanks a ton to Kkottonmouthkngz for including two(!) of these is a random box trade. This was a huge want of mine."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to Treebs for giving this to me as an extra(!) in a trade. Thanks!"
"Heady Topper","16oz aluminum tall boy. Coded, looks like canned on 1/23/12"
"Heady Topper","Given to me by a friend who stopped by the brewery last week - a very unexpected and pleasant surprise. Drank from the can."
"Heady Topper","Serving type can"
"Heady Topper","One of my pals went down to Vermont 3 weeks ago and picked a few cans of this up at the brewery. Being 3 weeks old, I know it's not at its prime but I'll probably never have another chance to review this."
"Heady Topper","A - Pours an inch of white head which has nice retention and leaves tons of lacing. The beer is unfiltered resulting in a hazy brew with a pale orange hue."
"Heady Topper","Got some of these on a recent beer trip to VT. Glad In did too, man is this one killer IPA. Official review now. PT sized can..."
"Heady Topper","Have had multiple times since then and updating some things"
"Heady Topper","This is a must try if you fancy yourself a beer drinker... I really was impressed by this beer when I first tried it six or so months ago and I have been buying a few 4 packs a month ever since. "
"Heady Topper","One of a number of outstanding beers at the Imminent Liquidation tasting. This is a beer I've wanted to try for some time."
"Heady Topper","The balance of a unique hoppiness with just enough malt combines with a smooth mouthfeel that seems almost surreal given the style of beer. I usually feel a bit more bite in even the better DIPA's I've had previously. "
"Heady Topper","""Stopped by the Alchemist cannery the other day on a recent trip to VT and sampled some freshly brewed Heady Topper. All I can say is, WOW! By far, one of the best beers that I’ve tried to date, regardless of style, and a sure ‘must-try’ for all who appreciate the finer beers of the world. Hoping that this becomes more available in MA, because as of now, there are only a few places that you can enjoy this ‘world-class’ brew. I’ve yet to try Pliny, but have read that this DIPA rivals it. If you get the opportunity to try this, it’s a must. Kudos Alchemist, looking forward to other offerings in the near future."""
"Heady Topper","A: Poured about 3oz into glass. Murky golden yellow, small head disipates quickly."
"Heady Topper","There isn't much that can be said about this holy elixir that hasn't already been said -- aside from the fact that given the opportunity I'd probably crawl in the can to live out the rest of my years (which are most likely a good number). I get to enjoy this usually every month or so, and simply put: it's the best out there. I've had it 7 days old and 7 months old. Nothing beats it fresh but even after half a year it still tastes incredible. Pour half in a snifter and enjoy half in the can. The smell upon cracking that can will blow you away. Definitely my favorite double IPA out there and probably my favorite overall. It will never get old. The hype is real! If you have a chance to get your hands on this, do so...by any means possible. (well maybe not ANY)"
"Heady Topper","A - This is what Sting was singing about in ""Waves of Gold."" Beautiful hazy color with slightly less head than I'd want."
"Heady Topper","I mentioned to a co-worker that I was just in Vermont and found nothing (good) locally other than 'Long Trail' and he hit me with a pint can of Heady Topper - Thanks Will !!! - I poured some into a tulip and left some in the can whilst alternating sips - and before I knew it - it was all gone !! - and i wished I had more - poured hazy and light orange with suspended spherical globules (of the hop resin?) - like a little universe of it's own in my glass - a 1 finger head that dissipated into a slight film reaching out to a 1/4 inch ring - the hops were in the air as soon as i 'pulled the pop-top' - the zing and zest of hops resin was immediate and awesome - just sticky enough with a mildly sweet finish - this beer is amazing for all the right reasons - hype be damned!"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into a snifter. (Yes, I'm disobedient.)"
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper, $9 can at Blind Tiger in NYC, to benefit Vermont farmers affected by Hurricane Irene."
"Heady Topper","From the can, as instructed. If there's a canning date, I can't find it."
"Heady Topper","Can from pushkinwow, thanks a ton for sending this one over Steve. 16oz can into a tulip, canned January 23, 2012. 700th review."
"Heady Topper","Live tasting 16 oz can into Duvel tulip..."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to beerhan for this awesome extra."
"Heady Topper","16oz can...supposedly canned on Feb 14th 2012, but no date noted on the can. Served at around 45F. Big thanks to Ryan for this trade!!!"
"Heady Topper","I've been drinking these over the past few months and the batches have varied a bit. All I can say is, if you live near Healthy Living in South Burlington VT, grab a 4 pack today (toward the back). This is the best batch I've had. The tropical juice is just sublime. I did have one batch where I hardly detected any juice, it was most straight up hops. This one is just right. Juicy. Piney."
"Heady Topper","One of my favorites ... I buy a case every other month or so."
"Heady Topper","Pretty stoked to have this beer. Poured some into a glass so I could see it, and the rest I drank out of a can."
"Heady Topper","This brew is only one word and that is FANTASTIC! totally lives up to all the hype. its a must try before you die beer."
"Heady Topper","Had this straight from the can as recommended. Was a little strange as I NEVER drink straight from the can/bottle, but I have to say it worked. Such a well balanced beer I could not believe it. Outrageous hop flavor but zero bitter bite. Excellent malt profile. The sweet hop taste lingered well after I had finished the can."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to claaark13 for this. "
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from the can, which was purchased the same day of canning. This particular can was drank 1 day after canning."
"Heady Topper","Big shout out to SilentJay for picking me up a case of this when he was up in VT this weekend and meeting me when I flew into Boston/NH for a few weeks. A mystery box will be coming his way soon. Should have been a batch within a week, two max."
"Heady Topper","Pours a nice hazy orange a with a big creamy white head on top. A fair amount of sticky lace left behind. "
"Heady Topper","Reviewing straight from can to mouth per the request of the brewer. Poured a small amount in a Duvel tulip to assess appearance."
"Heady Topper","can aquired from trade with shcufj. no freshness info."
"Heady Topper","I've had many a can of Heady Topper over the past few months, and with each one I'd hoped that my opinion of the beer would change for the better. I'll review my inaugural taste here, as it hasn't changed at all really. 16 oz. can poured into a Duvel tulip. Reviewed from notes."
"Heady Topper","My man Dino hooked up a 4 pack which he said was canned a week and a half ago. I immediately opened one. The can says to drink out of the can so for appearance I poured the 2nd can into a pint glass. The beer in glass pours a cloudy golden color, light from the pale malts, good retention and lacing. The rest of this review will be from the can. The aroma is huge and heavy as soon as you crack the beer. Tons of tropical citrus hop character assault your senses. I guess I should have expected as much from the 120 IBUs. I can't tell how this beer could smell any better: no hint of alcohol and an overload of hops. Perfect. The taste build on the aroma, if that is even possible, you again are assaulted with the tropical citrus hop flavor and yet a bit of piney resin is prevalent, too. Unbelievably smooth. Unreal how balanced this beer is. Malty sweetness with fruity character from the hops. Clean. Smooth. Medium bitterness, not over the top, no clue this is 8%abv. Amazing flavor. Again, not sure how this can get any better. The mouthfeel is full and creamy and rich and smooth. Very well balanced. Overall, this beer is phenomenal. Perhaps because it was fresh, this is now the standard for DIPAs, sorry Pliny. I will do whatever I can to obtain more. Terrific."
"Heady Topper","A: Pours hazy, golden. Lighter color than I expected but still beautiful. Reminds me of a dank heffeweizen...haze for days. Very little head that dissipates quickly."
"Heady Topper","16oz. can, purchased at the brewery. No coding. Told by an employee that it was ""probably"" canned on 2/10/12. It's fresh, okay?!"
"Heady Topper","Recieved in a trade along with fresh Hopslam from NDAK, thanks man, we will swap again."
"Heady Topper","Appearance- Cloudy orange, can't see threw, small white head with small group of bubbles in the middle, head dissipates quickly. The cloudiness makes me think there is a ton of hops in it. "
"Heady Topper","Appearance: N/A Enjoyed from the can, as the brewer recommends"
"Heady Topper","I scored 3 four packs of this beer thanks to my parents who had vacationed briefly in VT. Trying this out of a glass first, then out of the can for kicks and giggles... because it says so. Something about releasing the hop aromas. "
"Heady Topper","I’m torn here. The brewers leave instructions on the can. Rather than enjoy the beer poured out into a glass, as common sense dictates, they wish us to drink it straight from the can. Normally, I’d do as the brewer says, no questions asked. This kind of goes against my principles though. In the end I decided to enjoy it from my New Belgium globe, though I did decant it, again, as dictated on the can. If I’m ever able to score another can or two or this, I’ll try it straight from the can and see which experience I find more enjoyable."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to my Fraternity brother Devin who lives out in VT now for sending me two 4 packs of HT."
"Heady Topper","Got a 4-pack from a friend who just returned from Waterbury. Probably as fresh as it comes directly from the cannery. "
"Heady Topper","Side by side comparison with Hopslam. Pounder can poured into a tulip. This can was bottled in mid-December. My girlfriend has just gotten into DIPAs, so she is enjoying this too! It should be a good night!"
"Heady Topper","Poured in a tulip at the British Beer Company in Walpole, MA."
"Heady Topper","Straight pour from a 16oz can to a straight-lipped Ommegang flute (the glass included in the 2011 gift packs), but sampled partly from the can for tasting and aroma notes as well. No date on the can, but one week ago the (very, very good) friend who gave this to me said he bought it the weekend prior, so my guess is this is 2 ½ - 3 ½ weeks old at the most. I’d say it’s pretty fresh. And yes, I did drink this from the can first! "
"Heady Topper","A: Poured some into a glass just to see what it looks like. It's a super cloudy pale sort of orange. Good solid offwhite head. Retention is quite good too. Decent lacing. "
"Heady Topper","My son brought this home after a trade for a 4 pack of this for a Dark Lord."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can poured into oversized CBS snifter."
"Heady Topper","Thanks goes out to Hojaminbag, and dsgolovin for this brew."

"Heady Topper","Many, many thanks to BAs hoppymcgee and jedwards for sending Heady Topper cans within mere days of each other; as this is one from a 4-pack sent by hoppymcgee, I'm reviewing it."
"Heady Topper","Un. Real. "
"Heady Topper","Ok I will admit it - I did not believe the hype. So many times beers that are hyped up so much let me down, but this absolutely delivered. "
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed my first two Heady Topper's today. Purchased from Woodstock Hops N Barley in Woodstock, VT."
"Heady Topper","Received a couple cans of fresh HT from BaconSausage as extras in a recent Trade."
"Heady Topper","This was canned freshly last week and was sent to me through the mail. Something everyone on this website must try, my pallate was in heaven during the consumption of this hoppy yet amazing beverage"
"Heady Topper","16oz can with ""1 12 23A 2 BB"" stamped along the bottom of the can. Not sure what this means, but I'm assuming the 1 if for January and the 12 for 2012?"
"Heady Topper","Served in a Rogue shaker pint glass."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Mrebeka for grouping this with a trade… I owe you one!"
"Heady Topper","A pint can, poured into my DFH Signature Glass. I'll enjoy this beer in a glass-just like every beer is meant to be drank."
"Heady Topper","Gifted to me from eyebrews, one outstanding beer lover and guy."
"Heady Topper","WOW... if this review would accept just a WOW and not making me use 250 characters! WOW is all you need to know! "
"Heady Topper","heady thanks to heelsn02 for the can. unexpected after he gave me a blind tasting of this, Pliny, and hopslam. "
"Heady Topper","A day when a box of gems and treats arrived from some friends. A Variety of Russian River Brews, KBS, Parabola, BA Old Raspy. "

"Heady Topper","poured from can into Ithaca Beer pub pint glass (I don't know what the real name is...) as I prefer to see the beer I am drinking even though they say to drink it out of the can"
"Heady Topper","This is the most amazing beer I've ever had. The chunks in the beer are a tiny bit off-putting, but they're the result of the extreme amount of hop resins in the beer. I'll take the resins anytime if that's the trade-off."
"Heady Topper","A beer that can hold its own with Pliny!"
"Heady Topper","Drank one from can, one from glass, liked it from the glass better so I will review from glass."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can into Piraat tulip glass"
"Heady Topper","132nd Review"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to MBAcoach for sending this my way. "
"Heady Topper","scored a 4 pack from jamvt via trade. thanks a ton for the swap Jeremy"
"Heady Topper","Thanks Ashley for the trade again for some fresh heady. Poured from the can into a snifter, amber golden color with nice initial head that recedes quick with sticky lacing rim. Cloudy and chunky but so damn inviting. Nose is great with hops hops and floral aromas. Taste is the king on the heady. Explosion of hops and bitterness that is balanced on initial hit to the palate and then the hops and piney bitterness builds. The finish on this beer is amazing. "
"Heady Topper","Poured from a chilled can into my iced Cigar City pint glass. I know the rage is to drink this delight from the can, but I will offer another perspective."
"Heady Topper","reviewing the taste 1st out of the can as suggested before i pour in a glass to review the rest. "
"Heady Topper","Picked up in Burlington, before a gig at the Radio Bean..."
"Heady Topper","Drank straight from the can, but I poured a small amount in to a snifter to rate the appearance even though I feel like it is tough to rate on that since the brewer clearly wants it to be drank from the can."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper from can into a snifter. 3 day old can from cannery, reviewed from notes."
"Heady Topper","Cloudy brownish orange body with tiny floaters. The head is brief and thin. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks Ted!"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Adrian for this one."
"Heady Topper","This is a really good beer. The can says to drink from the can, so who am I to disobey a direct order. I can't really judge the appearance this way, but the can has a cool design. The smell is a certain citrusy aroma with hints of the can mixed in the smell. The taste is perhaps the most balanced DIPA. the hops are not overpowering, and the flavor is exceptionally complex. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, and a sour hop flavor come to the forefront. The most remarkable element is the smooth mouthfeel. One might even say it goes down soft. The aftertaste does not limit the experience, but takes it in a different direction. The citrusy flavors sweeten like candy. Most DIPAs express punch of bitter hops at this point, so this was surprising and refreshing. This beer is definitley worth the hype."
"Heady Topper","Picked up a couple six-pack at the cannery. I'm told they were packaged just a week ago."
"Heady Topper","Recieved in a trade with Fluke828! What a great guy! Thanks man."
"Heady Topper","Canned on Tuesday, Drank on Wednesday (from the can, naturally)."
"Heady Topper","A: Poured a vibrant golden amber with a huge white fluffy head that I could eat with a spoon. Retention and lacing were phenomenal. Looks much darker than expected."
"Heady Topper","Drank from the can mostly. "
"Heady Topper","no date on the can..."
"Heady Topper","I was brewing beer with friends when this appeared out of the fridge and in my glass. It's blood-orange and gold appearance made me wonder as the story of how it wound up in Rocky Point, NY was explained to me. "
"Heady Topper","Many thanks to Jordan23 for the awesome surprise!"
"Heady Topper","A - Pours a straw yellow, very hazy, with a foamy two finger white head. Speckled lacing clings nicely. "
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into a Sierra Nevada Tulip, shared with KevinmusPrime, reviewed from notes"
"Heady Topper","Received in trade w/ a VT BA (Cheers!)"
"Heady Topper","This one pours pretty cloudy, with little bits floating around. If you pour it into a glass (which I prefer, but the brewery discourages), leave the dregs, as you would a homebrew. "
"Heady Topper","One of the beers in it's class. We are very lucky to have this beer up here in Vermont. The taste, as it should be, is the best part to this beer. It tastes great from the can or in a glass (even though it recommends drinking it straight from the can. The appears is good and the smell is great very fruity. Outstanding taste and a great overall beer. Hard to top this one!"
"Heady Topper","Picked up a fresh 4-pack at the Healthy Living Market in Burlington, Vt. Definitely one of the more beautiful cans I've ever purchased."
"Heady Topper","From 16oz tallboy to my Hess Imperial pint glass on 12/15/11"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Jason for getting me a can of this! I drank it from the can but poured some out to get a look at the beer."
"Heady Topper","16oz can divided between a snifter and the can."
"Heady Topper","A christmas present from duffextra cold. "
"Heady Topper","16oz can. Poured 4oz sample glass and drank the rest from the can."
"Heady Topper","After I had a few sips from the can, as suggested by the brewery, I poured it into a tulip glass to have a look.   I'm glad I did! It's an attractive one!  A nice finger of head develops and the color is that of dried apricot fruit. There is a small amount of sediment floating about, but not much and it doesn't detract.  The head dissipates to nearly nothing, but some ultra fine lace remains that sticks to the glass with every sip. "
"Heady Topper","I have had 3 batches of the canned heady topper, the first was great, the third was great, but the second batch i had canned sometime in mid november was absolutely sublime."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can brought straight from the brewery. Drank first half from the can as per the instructions and then second half I had to pour into my dogfish snifter to take a look at this great brew."
"Heady Topper","Can poured into a couple Spaten glasses. Thanks so much to Azdback for sharing this with me!"
"Heady Topper","Cracked the can and poured into a glass. A nice orange color with lots of head and tons of shit floating in it. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the floaties but I certainly needed to deduct some points for that. I would normally just drink it from the can, as the can states, so it would not be an issue for me. This is a hop bomb, plain and simple. It is up there with the best of the best hop bombs. I love this beer and you will too."
"Heady Topper","Received a 1 PINT can of this from mdvatab in a recent trade (fresh!). Poured from the silver can w/ the ""Alchemist"", HEADY TOPPER, & DRINK FROM THE CAN! all in black into a 16oz pint glass (but only half the can). Enjoyed the rest straight from the can so I could review half and enjoy ""how it should be"" the rest. Has 11020B2BB on the back but no sign of freshness date. "
"Heady Topper","This beer is magical. Had it brewery direct via a couple buddies just a few days after it was ""canned"". This is by far the best IIPA I have ever tasted. I'm sorry Pliny. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to tjkinate for this one. The infamous Heady Topper! Now I can say I've had the three best DIPAs out there (Heady, Abrasive, and PtE). Served from the can with a bit poured into my Darkness snifter for appearance. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Jeff and Erik for sharing this one during the BA tasting in Utrecht. Had this one side-to-side with the Dreadnaught IPA"
"Heady Topper","A : Golden to amber color, large bubbles, some chill haze, some hop/protein coagulates, but if allowed to sit, you can decant most of this off if it bothers you (doesn’t bother me). Not much lacing or head retention."
"Heady Topper","I finally made the 3 hour drive to get some Heady Topper."
"Heady Topper","Inflatablechair supplied this one at a recent tasting.... badass... finally, I got to try Heady topper."
"Heady Topper","From a glass with about a third from the can."
"Heady Topper","Canned on Dec 13, 2011. Poured in to CBS Snifter. "
"Heady Topper","Pours an inch tal white head. Spotty lacin, average head retention."
"Heady Topper","16oz can, Sam Adam's Perfect Pint and red wine glass, canned 12/6/11. Huge, big thanks to Jayli in Secret Santa 2011!"
"Heady Topper","Fresh from the can...then poured into my Darkness snifter."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to cbeer88 for this one!"
"Heady Topper","I had this beer during a very nice tastingsession at doopiedoopiedoo's house where a bunch of Dutch BA came together."
"Heady Topper","I was able to try this beer at a tasting organized by Jeffo and Doopiedoopiedoo. Read some more about the tasting on my review of The Brewery - Black Tuesday. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to satchboogie on shipping this one in a trade. Phenomenal nose, as good as Pliny or Hopslam. I really would say for my taste these 3 would b interchangeable as far as which one I like best. Number ratings don't tell how even they are. I drank from a glass on the first one can the next two. Looks great as fresh world class DIPA should, nice foam and you can get lost with your nose in the glass. Citrus, and lost of it, smooth hops, and a lot of that too, On my 1st can I was thinking of Pliny in a way to compare, but after having a few over the last few days I'm changing that up a bit. It comes on first sip like Pliny, then somewhere along the line the overwhelming hops kicks in and it's more similar to Alpines Pure Hoppiness. Nicely bitter, but not crushingly so, balanced as hell. Just a tremendous brew, surely equal to anything brewed anywhere that's a DIPA. It this was easily available I'd be 300 lbs."
"Heady Topper","Joe you are the man and thank you for this one. alright from notes i reviewed this one at a christmas party, which i ran away to a dark corner to review like a zero. have to start off with the awesome can, silver and black tall boy with the alchemist on the front lovin life. pours a deep transparent amber with a big off white head and it shows great retention. solid in the nostrils very citrusy with light pine and lemon peel dryness. very fresh hops and minimal malt sweetness, pale and biscuty. the taste is absolute cash, very fresh hop resin, again the citrus peel with an amazing bitterness that cuts the palate. bone dry finish. medium bodied and lightly carbonated and flows really easy without any ""spiking"" to my surprise. this is the one that will make your gf not want to kiss you, the one where your breath still reeks of hops the next morning. flying hop dragons punching babies, can't stop em'. what a brew!"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can."
"Heady Topper","Straight from the can while at Frida's for lunch in Stowe. The tacos were good; the beer was freakin' unbelievable. "
"Heady Topper","Pours golden orange with a head that is thick and fluffy and retains. Aroma of bold citric and piney hops that is in your face in a good way, generous malts to back it up. Taste follows nose, so good so amazing. Smooth and easy to drink, I love this beer, it will perpetually stay in my wants!"
"Heady Topper","The Alchemist Heady Topper"
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to mar for trading me this can."
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a hazy, hop particle filled, reddish-orange color with a thick billowing white head that slowly retracts to a couple centimeters. Leaves a ton of lacing as sipped down."
"Heady Topper","Can picked up straight from The Alchemist Cannery. This specific can is a bit more than a month old. I enjoyed two out of glasses over the last few weeks. As the can suggests, I am reviewing this directly from the can."
"Heady Topper","This batch was canned on December 7th, and I drank it on December 13th so it's an extremely fresh batch. Was poured into a snifter. Poured an amazing 3 finger head which stuck around for a good while. The color is a glossy orange. Smells like anything citrus. Oranges are a big aroma in this beer. The smell is intense and when you take a drink you can taste everything that you smell. Alcohol is barely present as the flavors balance the beer out very well. A bit of bitterness at the end, but like I said, everything is balanced well. "
"Heady Topper","16oz can "
"Heady Topper","This review is comprised from notes taken on multiple days from multiple cans consumed from either a snifter or the can itself as suggested. There really isn’t much difference between the can and glass version. "
"Heady Topper","Reviewing the Heady Topper from The Alchemist."
"Heady Topper","It's in a can. It appears as a silver can. I got the last bit of the can at a tasting, and at the can's insistence, consumed it out of the can."
"Heady Topper","Got this as an extra in a trade with Plenum. Cheers buddy! "
"Heady Topper","Can't really tell what it looks like until you pour it out, comes out a hazy witbier (now with bigger chunks!) looking beer, but the vibrancy of the golden color is still nice, ample head size."
"Heady Topper","Huge thank you for DrewShal9 for this!"
"Heady Topper","Thank you Lambicking for 12 cans of this. Truly my favorite beer."
"Heady Topper","Served in a Duvel Tulip"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to THE CPJ for the beauty, been wanting to try it for some time. Drank from the can as instructed, except for a tiny 2oz pour to grade appearance."
"Heady Topper","Purchased at the Alchemist Cannery on a beerventure and poured into my Duvel tulip."
"Heady Topper","16oz can, huge thanks to Kevin (thebouch01) for scoring this at the Jackie O's release and handing it over to me!"
"Heady Topper","I got this can from someone at the CL release, basically as a present. I don't remember the BA handle, but he's opening a brewery in Jersey. Thanks!"
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a clear honey color; barely any head or lacing"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can to a Cigar City Snifter."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to LambicKing for this one. Lives up to all the hype"
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip glass for appearance...the rest of the review is from the can as the brewer intended."
"Heady Topper","Dare I call this beer perfect? Without a doubt one of my favorites. I've never had the pleasure of having one on tap, but upon cracking a can, the smell of hops overpowers everything within arms length - it's really quite impressive. While John Kimmich recommends drinking out of the can, I drank one from the can, one from the glass. "
"Heady Topper","Drank from a can, just like it says."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 22oz Can into a 4oz Snifter. "
"Heady Topper","well, there's some hype about this one, and I hate trains, but I'm on it. Was lucky to get 16 heady's through a trade in person in Bruges, thanks Hopo ;-) Already had a couple of previews through tendermorsel, and knew what I was getting. "
"Heady Topper","HUGE thanks to my awesome girlfriend for bringing me a can of this back from thanksgiving break."
"Heady Topper","Very hazy amber pour. Sediment is suspended throughout. Two fingers of pillowy off white head. Scant lacing is left behind on my glass. Hops and citrus collide in my nose. Looks and smell are living up to the hype. The first striking character upon taste is the creaminess. Incredibly so especially for an ipa. Pine and grapefruit up front. Sweetness to finish the swallow. Ends lightly bitter. Honestly it is not as hoppy as I expected. Very easy to drink regardless that it is an imperial. "
"Heady Topper","Reviewed from a pair of fresh 2 day old cans. One was poured into a Duvel tulip, and one drank straight from the can for comparison. "
"Heady Topper","finally getting around to reviewing this. about 10 days since its canning. poured into my hill farmstead pint glass. "
"Heady Topper","A fresh can into a standard pint glass."
"Heady Topper","One of only a few 4 packs left at a Burlington area grocery store. The beer guy said it would be gone soon, as the first order of 160 cases disappeared in less than 4 days."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to mkabull and AutumnBeerLove for sending me fresh cans(on the same day)! "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to mtardiff for sending me a 4 pk. No canned on date. Against the recommendation on the can, I poured into a snifter."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into a Duvel Tulip - totally ignoring the instructions to drink from a can (I'll drink the next one from the can). Thanks to rhong187 for the hookup."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to jsthomas for sending this to me."
"Heady Topper","Had this on 2011-11-20 in Columbia, PA. This was canned four days ago. I've had this about twelve more times since this initial review (most recently on 2016-03-06 from a 1-week-old can) and it remains very high on my list."
"Heady Topper","Thanks go out to Ryan for hooking me up with this stellar double IPA. I have had it a couple times now, both directly from the can and decanted into a pint or tulip on various occasions."
"Heady Topper","Big thx to Hopopotomous for this awesome DIPA !!"
"Heady Topper","Poured into my Jackie O's snifter. Shared with IrishColonial."
"Heady Topper","A: straight out of the can and if this were a woman, I would be in trouble for saying that this is one nice can. Cheesy joke for you guys!"
"Heady Topper","A: Pours a very hazy light apricot/peach color. One of the cloudiest IPA's i've seen. Definitely unfiltered. The head is thin and pretty white."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can pour straight into the mouth. Thanks go to Funkel81 for this generous extra in a recent trade. "
"Heady Topper","Served in an unchilled beer glass."
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into a snifter"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 oz can into a Sierra Nevada hop tulip glass."
"Heady Topper","picked up a case of these gems over the weekend. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to loftis CT for the hookup!"
"Heady Topper","A- Thick, creamy looking body and a super sticky head. Long long long lasting retention, beautiful two fingers developed easy from the pour into my glass. Tons of singular bubbles give me the hope of a crisp tall drank. The perfect lacing... its been a long time since I've seen a work of art such as this. This deep amber, almost like a warmed caramel coloration does tons for me. "
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can. Canned 2 weeks ago."
"Heady Topper","Reviewed From Notes, Poured into a Tulip on 11/12/11"
"Heady Topper","16 oz can, part poured into tulip, part sampled from the can as suggested. Thanks to Titosupertramp for this one. "
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to gtreid for sendin me home after our tasting with a can of this! Pours a clear honey orange color first followed by all the yeast towards the bottom of the can. The floaties are everywhere! Looks like a gelatin almost. Smells like a tropical Christmas tree - big pine sap, pineapple, mango, and sweet malts. Hop bomb from the get go, but not so bitter, just really delicious citrus hop characters. Not incredibly complex, but just brewed to near perfection. This has to be my favorite DIPA next to Pliny the Elder. If you haven't had it, you've got to get some."
"Heady Topper","A+ in my book, just a fantastic and well rounded beer."
"Heady Topper","Longtime reader first time reviewer, not that I need to. The jury is already in on this beer. As a die hard IPA/DIPA chasing the latest and greatest available to me I just have to say this beer is a double edge sword. This IPA is so fantastic, that if it is not readily available to you and you are a diehard hophead I and others I know would nearly recommend not trying this beer and especially if you do not have more than a couple in your possesion. This beer has nearly ruined many other IPAs and DIPAs for me, I still enjoy them, but this has clearly set the standard. Also, I truly agree, do drink from the can, it is better than in a glass. I look forward to my first from a tap though. Warning over, onto my brief review. This beer bursts with grapefruit, citrus, lemon? white fruit and some very clean pine. Just amazing flavors that seem to change as you go through the can. The malt backbone is right where Ilike it in a beer of this strength. Its subtle but full arriving just before the fruit of the hops set in and leaves just in time for the bitterness to take over and make you want more. I try to limit myself to one of these per session so that it remains so special. As a last note, I do not know what hops are in this beer but I think columbus and cascade are here, for all I know there are many more."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: Beautiful golden body with a sizable head and great lacing."
"Heady Topper","16oz can thanks to youbrewidrink. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks goes to nathanjohnson for the chance to try this beer."
"Heady Topper","Can from Dr Greg - grazie amigo! Shared with buds. Poured a cloudy orange with a decent white head Nose is lemon / grapefruit citrusy and huge on the hops. Taste is slippery sweet and well integrated among the hop resins and citrus / fruit flavors. Finished off with a nice bitterness and soft bite. The lasting finish is well balanced. Loved this one."
"Heady Topper","Notes from several weeks ago, fresh can."
"Heady Topper","woah. orange-amber with a slight haze. off-white head with good retention and pretty lace. nose is grapefruit, orange, blood-orange, pineapple, mango, papaya, passionfrut, piney tropicalness harmonized near-perfectly with a caramel graininess that simply rocks. taste is all of the above with the perfect amount of bitter/dry to balance. this is as heady as it comes. yes, I said heady. bitter in the finish with pine singing, but tropical fruitiness lingering. all good things about hops are here amplified by all good things about malty harmony. thick, yet light and fluffy. fanf'ingtastic. thanks al. and alchemist."
"Heady Topper","A: Orange colored pour into snifter with off white head leaving moderate lacing. "
"Heady Topper","Aroma:Sweet orange and grapefruit, peaches, cotton candy. Smells delightful."
"Heady Topper","Despite the declaration on the can to ""drink from it"" i did half in the can and half in a tulip"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can to a sniffer. "
"Heady Topper","Oh, a beer amongst beers! The Alchemist has done a great justice to the world with the Heady Topper. I've rarely seen a better looking DIPA, smelled a finer flower, nor tasted anything as hoppy and honeyed. I'm not sure what kind of black magic this brewery dabbles in, but this beer is a incantatory balance of hop and malt. It's sweet (but just right), it's hoppy and piney, resin-y, and brilliantly citrus-y. If I ever have an imperial IPA better than this, I might just call it the best I could ever have. I'm serious."
"Heady Topper","Poured from 16oz can into an Alchemist pint glass."
"Heady Topper","As per suggestion I tried this out of the can ""briefly"" and yup, knew it wouldn't work for me. Evaluated by pouring straight down the middle very slowly into a nonic pint glass, letting the head settle, then topping up later. At first about 4 oz was only poured in the nonic pint glass, with the can to be evaluated afterwards."
"Heady Topper","16oz cans, love 'em! First beer I've sampled from The Alchemist. Hazy golden yellow/orange pour with a nice creamy white head on top. Lots of hop sediment so be careful on the pour. Aromas are a blast of deep fruity, tropical hops. Such a wonderful, juicy, resinous hop blend that I could easily sit and inhale all night long. I would advise to drink this hoppy treat as fresh as possible."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Deuane for giving me one of his cans so I can finally taste the heady. Can poured into a standard pint."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can. I had the first few sips from the can and then decided to pour this one into a glass to do get a proper score on appearance. I'll drink any future ones right from the can, I promise."
"Heady Topper","16oz can, consumed therefrom."
"Heady Topper","Much thanks to Adam for this can, you rock!"
"Heady Topper","A big thank you to pokesbeerdude for sending this as an extra in his portion of the Willpower LIF."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to mountsnow1010. Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Poured into a Surly pint glass. A semi-hazy burnt orange color. Few and far between, large, carbonation bubbles lead to a very small head. As I swirl my glass I get just the smallest hint of, off white colored head. There isn't any lace to speak of."
"Heady Topper","Wow! Big thanks to Adamdc for sending this beer to me in a trade. Sometimes a beers hype is really spot on. This is one of those times. The can says it should be drank from a can. Force of habit finds me pouring this into a Imperial Pint glass."
"Heady Topper","My buddy grabbed me two four packs from the Brewery in VT. Fresh canned two days ago!!"
"Heady Topper","Heady on tap pours hazy dark gold with an enormous fluffy white head. The retention is excellent and the lacing very sticky and attractive. Huge aroma of hoppy complexity; so much going on in the nose, from citrus (mostly grapefruit and pineapple) to pine to floral notes and traces of very slightly onion-like notes as well."
"Heady Topper","Received in trade from GoGriz.  Poured from 16oz. can into a Stone snifter.  Beer was a clear, orange color, with a one-finger, white head.  Head quickly faded, leaving behind some faint traces of lacing around the glass.  Moderate carbonation. "
"Heady Topper","16oz can (no dates/codes) - thanks again cavedave for this unexpected, unsolicited treat, beer karma lives! - partially poured into a snifter to evaluate appearance; the remainder drunk from the can per the text on the can."
"Heady Topper","Had at Track 84 10/28"
"Heady Topper","Pours an amber orange color with a two finger off white head with settles down to 1/4 inch and stays. Very nice tropical aroma with pineapple. mango, and grapefruit. "

"Heady Topper","898th Review on BA"
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can poured into my cigar city tulip. Thanks go out to andyavalanche for hookin me up with one of my top wants."
"Heady Topper","Went against the recommendation and poured this puppy up. Deep caramel orange enhanced haziness from hop residues. Immediately the smell is a citrus bomb. This beer combines so many great citrus notes. It is as if the fruit is from some hybrid tree that only grows in Vermont. I would say the grapefruit is the star though. Crisp taste with some tangy bites. Very fresh hop notes. The mouth feel is almost as impressive as the taste. This is almost described as creamy to my palate. Overall this is the best IPA I have tasted."
"Heady Topper","Pours orange with a fluffy white head. Nose is bursting with oily hops, orange candy, pine resin. Sticky and delightful. Flavor is a collage of brightly bitter hops, grapefruit rind, orange rock sugar. Finish is long and grapefruity. Very nice stuff."
"Heady Topper","Drank directly from the can, as the can itself instructed me to do. The hoppy goodness literally filled the room. I could smell the can from several feet away, beckoning me to come take a sip. I pulled it right from my fridge so I gave it about five minutes before I took my first sip after opening. Probably five of the most grueling minutes of anticipation in my life. There is obviously a lot of hype around this beer so I knew I was in for a treat. "
"Heady Topper","A-Well it says to drink from the can so I am. The can looks pretty good..."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 oz can shared by fellow BA CosmicEvan. Consumed outbid a snifter. "
"Heady Topper","1 pint can poured into SN pint glass. It says drink from the can, but for the sake of review it got poured."
"Heady Topper","A - Hazy light orange with a thin layer of white head made of extremely small bubbles. Fades to a ring almost instantly."
"Heady Topper","Just here to say that this thing is definitely worth the hype it always recieved and I am thrilled that they took the leap to start packaging it (cans...awesome!) and thus making it available to everyone."
"Heady Topper","1 pint tall can poured into a fantome tulip glass.  I, too, could not bring myself to drink straight out of the can, but I have another one that I will give it a whirl with."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Joey for the hookup on this one..."
"Heady Topper","Ok, so this is one I'll search for, gladly accept as extras or be willing to trade for again in the future!"
"Heady Topper","Although the can warns it will be hazy, it is way beyond that: murky and dirty looking with plenty of floaties and barely any head in spite of a very vigorous pour, Heady Topper does look BAD."
"Heady Topper","Pours a nice golden color with some haze. Left a nice lacing halfway around the glass. "
"Heady Topper","A: Nice golden amber body. Slight amount of white head. I only poured about 2 ounces into the glass because the can specifically advises to ""DRINK FROM THE CAN!"""
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to n2185 for the can. Canned 11 October 2011, from what I hear. Enjoyed 21 October 2011, reviewed from notes. I followed the instructions on the can and tried it before I poured it - delicious, and as described, more of the hop aromatics still in the flavor."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into snifter."
"Heady Topper","The silo can opens with a satisfying crack; almost immediately, massive hop aromas begin to make their way through the mouth. As directed, I take sips directly from the can."
"Heady Topper","16oz can into a Duvel tulip. Beer was a cloudy amber, with about a finger and a half of creamy white foam. Head didn't stick around for too long, and left minimal lacing along the sides of the glass. "
"Heady Topper","1 pint can from recent trade with mountainsnow 1010--a big thanks!"
"Heady Topper","A massive ""thank you"" to optimator13 for this 16 ounce can from my ""Want"" list. Archaic date code reads ""1 07 20A2 B B"" though I'm at a loss for how to accurately convert that to a canning date. Ignoring the ""drink from the can"" instructions near the lip, this one is poured into a Deschutes tulip glass..."
"Heady Topper","A chilled can is poured into a mini pint glass (the can advises to drink it right from the can, so I'm pouring out a reviewable amount and will drink the rest sans glassware)."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 oz. can and served in a DFH signature glass. Big thanks to Mike (Gushue3) for sending me a few of them!"
"Heady Topper","10/19/11- Review of a 16oz can marked 10720A2BB."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into an alchemist pint glass"
"Heady Topper","Poured into a snifter despite the can's instructions. I love the ""Don't be a D-bag, recycle this can!"" on the back."
"Heady Topper","Received as an extra from mkabull, thanks Alec!"
"Heady Topper","This was a trade from Cheezy Blaster, where he shared the best New England has to offer, and I sent along some of Northeast Ohio's best brews. This beer was among the batch, all of which came through unharmed and ready to drink!"
"Heady Topper","Drinking about half the can out of a small snifter, the rest from the can."
"Heady Topper","extremely excited to try this long time want. huge thanks to baconsausage for hooking this up in Growler BIF round 2."
"Heady Topper","Traded big for this one - a '11 DL for a four pack of this delicious stuff. Glad the brewery decided to can this beer! Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, resin, and a slight bit of citrus and dankness. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel. There is a bitterness finish, but it is pleasant, aromatic and not harsh at all. Tried this out of a can, but ended up too dangerously drinkable that way."
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured to a Duvel Tulip."
"Heady Topper","Acquired in a trade with greenmonstah."
"Heady Topper","A big, big THANKS to Damico for this can share. Pours a cloudy orange amber color with a nice white foam head. Aroma of grapefruit and earthiness, with some caramel mixed in. Has a sweet caramel taste with ridiculously perfect dank hop resiny hit. Smooth as can be. The harsh hop hit does not outlast the finish, leaving you with delicate grapefruit notes at the end of this perfection. Not overhyped."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Jnorton00 for this brew. It's better than Pliny (the Elder), but I'm not quite sure if it's Dreadnaught status (my gold standard). However, given it's abv, it's remarkable. The quintessential camping beer (and yes, the can contributes to this moniker). Everything you want and nothing you don't. Better price point and more convenient than Dreadnaught; just can't decide if it's as good or better. I guess it'll take another night of ""research"" to come to a conclusion :)"
"Heady Topper","A. Kinda ugly, watery deep yellow. Decent 3cm white head tho. Minor lacing. Nice silver can, which tells you to drink it from the can - I did not. Maybe another time. No canned on date that I can see - how lame. Get with the program, Alchemist, and don't advertise ""drink this beer immediatly"" and then neglect to tell us just how old it is. "
"Heady Topper","I was so excited when I got the cans a few weeks ago, I completely forgot to review the damn beer. Anyways, I know it's awesome, and esp in a tall boy can! Tasty crack cans!"
"Heady Topper","Tasty brew and my first form The Alchemist. "
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to jsvt for sending a 4 pack down my way. Drank from the can like instructed. Haha. Guess I'll have to review one from the glass next."
"Heady Topper","Gift from a buddy up north. Not inlaws, indigestion, or even nagging children could deter him from personally delivering the goods. Good man."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to Beefy for this can. "
"Heady Topper","Day old can picked up at the new cannery. Despite the advice of the can, poured into a nonic. "
"Heady Topper","Picked up a four-pack of this last weekend after the bottle release at the Alchemist pub."
"Heady Topper","Graciously offered by hoppymcgee in our most recent trade; what a huge treat, big shoutout. "
"Heady Topper","Drinking FROM THE CAN, no pour."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to KickInTheChalice for the pour."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for dropping this in my box."
"Heady Topper","16 oz can. No canning dates. Poured into a glass, despite the fact the can tells me not to."
"Heady Topper","A - A delightful deep orange, even the head, which was two fingers of irregular froth dithering to an uneven lace (really a sloppy cobweb) has an orange hue. Sediment chunks that float about make this the Goldschlager of DIPAs. "
"Heady Topper","Poured a cloudy orange-amber with a finger of loose white head. Aroma of sweet caramel, tangerine, grapefruit, and light pine."
"Heady Topper","Provided to me by good friend and fellow BA rfgetz..."
"Heady Topper","Can purchased at the source one week ago, canned two days before that, so yeah its fresh..."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a 16oz can into my Alchemist tumbler. (14oz poured into the glass). Purchased from the cannery on 10/9/11."

"Heady Topper","Can courtesy of andrewinski1, thanks again!"
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured to my La Fin Du Monde tulip."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to sixthglass for this one. Tim came into my store on Friday to share this then came back on Monday to share a Westy 12 and gave me this can of Heady Topper for a Ten Fidy. Great BA, thanks Tim!"
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazed golden amber color with good cap of soapy white bubbles, good retention and lacing. Scent hits the nose with a big rush of tropical and citrus fruits... grapefruit, tangerine, mango, orange... slight presence of malt, finishes with a hint of grass. Taste starts off with a quick little bitter punch but quickly moves into a cocktail of tropical fruit with light citrus, again a faint presence of malt and a grassy and piney note at the end. Medium bodied, good carbonation, lacking some oily body preferred in the style. Overall, fantastic scent and taste make this beer highly drinkable and a great IPA."
"Heady Topper","Review from tasting notes. "
"Heady Topper","Andy donated a can towards my drinking. Excellent. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden straw with a finger of fluffy white head."
"Heady Topper","Poured from 16oz can into a tulip glass."

"Heady Topper","Received a couple cans as extras from GoGriz. I've read a lot about Heady Topper, so I'm really excited to try this!"
"Heady Topper","Pours a deep orange almost amber or brown with a frothy off white two finger head leaving supreme lacing down the glass."

"Heady Topper","16 oz can poured into a tulip. Courtesy of huadog (thanks Russ, you rock buddy). "

"Heady Topper","Thanks to Ashley for sending this my way! Poured into a taster glass. There is a nice one inch head on top of a hazy orange color. There isn't a ton of head retention on this particular can though."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into RR tion glass."
"Heady Topper","473ml can."
"Heady Topper","A: Dull light brownish-orange in color. Hazy. Forms about an inch of barely off-white head. Good stability, reducing slowly to a bubbly surface coating. Moderate lacing. "
"Heady Topper","Lucky enough to have a friend give me a can after stopping by the brewery this past weekend. Pouring a little less then half into an Allagash chalice and will drink the second half from the can, as commanded."
"Heady Topper","A: Pours cloudy and orange with a thick white foamy head. The head has a little staying power but leaves some great lacing behind."
"Heady Topper","Got a Heady Topper as an extra from Stakem and then the next day a box landed from Tanger that had another one of these cans, I can't tell you how pumped I was to recieve these. Thanks a bunch guys."
"Heady Topper","Nose comes out of the can . . . piney with an explosion of mixed citrus, also mildly tropical. Characteristics I've had before, but extremely well done here. "
"Heady Topper","Big Thanks to spwalshesq for the trade. Huge want of mine! And so worthy..."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to exitmusic00 for giving me one of these. Very generous of you sir! Tried directly from can as well as poured into a tulip."
"Heady Topper","From a five day old can on October 2, 2011."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to warriorsoul for the chance to try this one!"
"Heady Topper","Says to drink from the can but I just can't."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to spdkilz for this one"
"Heady Topper","So I was trying not to drink for a couple of weeks and then I get one of these as an extra from a very generous starrdogg. Thank you, Matt."
"Heady Topper","A: Pours in the typical DIPA fashion with a nice creamy haze."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to hooliganlife for hooking me up with this. 16 ounce can poured into New Belgium globe glass"
"Heady Topper","16oz can served in a can."
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into Deschutes snifter glass. No canning date, but they just started doing it so it's pretty darn fresh!"
"Heady Topper","Here we go..."
"Heady Topper","Ridiculously huge thanks to G311 for the brew; spreadin' love - that's just how G311 do thangs."
"Heady Topper","Presentation: 16 oz. can chilled from the second batch. Huge thanks to Phingdong for giving me this can for nothing. It was definitely appreciated. Poured into my Sam Adams pint glass (I know it says to drink from the can, but I didn't)."
"Heady Topper","got this guy this morning thanks to gueshue3, thanks buddy! I've been thinking abou this alll day at work."
"Heady Topper","A- pours a medium amber color with a finger of off white long lasting head."
"Heady Topper","TheDudeRules was kind enough to share a can."
"Heady Topper","Thanks Spence. Pint Can. Super haxzy orange ameber with a medium sized white head. Nose is full of hop resin, some sweetness, citrus. Flavor is similarly super resinous, sweet, mild bitterness. Pretty tasty, alcohol slightly noticeable. This is a very good beer and if you like super resinous double ipa's than this is probably your thing. To me, it was a little too sweet and green and lacked complexity."
"Heady Topper","This beauty was given to me by Jeffo from Tendermorsel from some other guy. Thank you all!"
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into a Pint Glass. Thanks to RSchaeffer for the 4 pack."
"Heady Topper","I'm following the instructions on the can to bypass the glass. Appearance the last time I poured it was a light copper that was a little hazy. Head was decent despite low carbonation. By the way, I love this giant can, especially that they worked in the term ""d-bag"" on the back."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can poured into a pint glass. Color is hazy and golden."
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can poured into a Portsmouth Brewery tulip. Deep golden, almost amber body with a fluffy white head that fades into a faint ring. Lots of floaties and other things dancing around in my glass."
"Heady Topper","Fresh can poured into a tulip glass (even if the can tells you to drink it straight out of the can, maybe for the next one). Thanks to AshleyMiller for the fast trade. Beer pours a dark bronze, very very hazy with lots of particles suspended in the beer making it so that you cannot see through the glass. Initial finger of off white bubbly head, mostly small and medium bubbles, recedes to a nice collar of bubbles and wispy film across the surface. Lots of gentle carbonation visible near the edge of the glass, floating slowly up. "
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Aberration for this can. Shared and reviewed with Kiddynamite920. Poured into two tulips at 50 degrees."
"Heady Topper","Funny story about this beer. At BOREFTS a couple nights ago, an American gentlemen asked me what American brews I'd really love to try. After thinking for a few seconds, Heady Topper jumped straight into my head. Love me some big IPAs, and this was the most recent well-regarded example on the market. Not one hour later I meet tendermorsel at the festival and he pulls two cans for us out of his backpack! The Secret really does work. Thanks for sending these over GoGriz, and thanks for doing the dirty work tendermorsel. "
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to both Mtardiff & BearsonAcid for providing this one. In one week I went from never having this beer to clutching 6 cans in my hand. This is the last of the six and needless to say, I’ll be getting more…. Somehow. Great beer. In fact, this review is being done with ½ the can in a glass and ½ being consumed out of the can. After all, that’s what the brewer tells you to do. (drink it from the can)"
"Heady Topper","16 oz. can poured into a Duvel Tulip Glass (despite the instructions to drink it from the can....well maybe I had one sip). Orange/amber/brown sugar/gold in color. Very hazy, certainly unfiltered. Not quite white, almost orange creamcicle in color head. It erupts at first and sticks around for a little bit, decent lacing. "
"Heady Topper","Can courtesy of nas5755. Many thanks to Nick for the chance to try this one. 16oz can poured into a tulip glass."
"Heady Topper","1,000 thanks to Harrymel for being the most generous BA I've ever came across since joining this site 2 and 1/2 years ago."
"Heady Topper","Pours a hazy light orange. Has a few floaties..."
"Heady Topper","Can given as an extra by SpdKilz, you rock man. Ridiculous extras as always, I've never had anything but great exchanges with that BA. Thanks again! "
"Heady Topper","A: Poured a lightly cloudy apricot color with good carbonation and a small dirty white cap which turns into a small thing bubbly layer"
"Heady Topper","big thanks to baconsausage!"
"Heady Topper","Poured from a can into a standard pint glass."
"Heady Topper","Consumed 9/22/11"
"Heady Topper","Can # 10720A2BB"
"Heady Topper","Can, thanks Seth! Hazy burnt orange pour with an off white head. Pine and citrus aromas. Outstanding balance, with smooth pine and resiny hop notes off set by a sturdy caramel malt backbone. Light citrus and floral undercurrents. Just a great freakin’ DIPA, and from a can. Kudos to the Alchemist Pub and Brewery..."
"Heady Topper","HUGE thanks goes to Spdklz for this!! Thanks Carelton!"
"Heady Topper","Served from the can, but a few oz. poured into a tasting glass to see the beer's appearance."
"Heady Topper","Did a side by side tasting of this one and Kern Citra dipa"

"Heady Topper",9/17/2011
"Heady Topper","Can shared by Whitemomba-- thanks Jason!"
"Heady Topper","16oz can provided by MrBarleywine, thanks for hooking me up Mike! "
"Heady Topper","Thanks Chris! Heady Topper pours out a hazy orange color, with just a small amount of white heading. Lively carbonation can be noticed, along with some sediment floating around. Very fruit forward nose, with passion fruit, pineapple, mango and a touch of sweet cream. Dank ass hops get things kicked off in the taste, giving off loads of fruit, spice and pine. Mouthfeel is medium in body, and the eight percent is masked perfectly. No doubt this is a world class IPA."
"Heady Topper","Beenitty is a total badass and a quality human being. I received this surprise package of 2 very fresh Heady Topper cans in the mail this morning, and could not wait for them to get cold to drink them. This is super fresh- about 11 days old total. What an amazing cool thing for him to do- Beenitty I will get you back man!"
"Heady Topper","Batch 2, about 8 days in the can. Poured a bit into my mini Duvel tulip, drank the rest from the can."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to SFLpunk for another fine trade that landed this treat in my hands. Much appreciated Jeff. Poured from a pint sized can into a tulip. This brew appears a hazed copper color. Very fine particulate is stuck throughout the suspension of this brew keeping it from being clear. A solid finger of creamy off-white head sits atop this brew and hold with very solid retaining powers. As the cap slowly fades, it completely coats the entire wall of the glass with an entire wall of lace."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to my local beer store for this surprise."
"Heady Topper","16oz. can served in my ST tulip (just couldn't bring myself to drink it out of the can). Pours a semi-hazy burnt orange with a rocky, one inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny craters. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim with a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some swaths and spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Love the nose on this beer - grassy, sweet citrus, earthy rind and a slight peppery quality towards the back; incredibly well-balanced. Taste follows nose - earthy bitterness presents up-front and sweet citrus and a suggestion of apricot follows. Finish leaves a slight residual bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation that is lively without being prickly. There's also a slightly oily texture. The more I drink this beer, the more I like it. Hopefully it will make it to Southern Vermont so I can get a bit more regular access. This beer is nothing short of fantastic - the balance is top notch, the alcohol is well-hidden and it is just so easy drinking. In my opinion, can tops bottle on this brew."
"Heady Topper","Fresh can. I did not follow the instructions on the can. I poured it at fridge temp into an imperial pint glass at."
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper pours a turbid orange with a soft white, two finger head. An early pour is relatively hazy while the last dregs contain flocculants that reintroduce themselves into suspension. "
"Heady Topper","Appearance -- Pours a gently hazed golden toast hue with amber highlights and a slim sudsy white head. Not much in the lacing department."
"Heady Topper","Regretfully the brewery got hit hard by Hurricane Irene and only the cannery remains, and thank hop god that it was not impacted."
"Heady Topper","This is what a Double IPA should be, and I'm glad to see someone on the East Coast finally making an IPA in a bottle or can to be proud of."
"Heady Topper","16oz can with no canned on or freshness date, but I know it is fresh because it is from the first canned batch that was canned not too long ago. I didn't listen to the ""Drink from the can"" instructions and poured into Hair of the Dog tulip. Reviewed on 9/14/11."
"Heady Topper","16oz can poured into tasting glass - thanks acviencko"
"Heady Topper","Was able to score 3 bottles in trade. This is a late review as I enjoyed the beer a while back."
"Heady Topper","Thanks Chris."
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed on our deck as the sun sets behind Camel's Hump."
"Heady Topper","Left in the can this time, like the brewmaster suggested. Shared with a friend yesterday, poured a yellow orange with some fairly sticky white head, not it's strong suit. Smell is mango, pine, orange, & a little floral. The best smelling IPA ever, at this point. Taste is same, so perfect. My expectations were sky high and this beer delivered the goods. Mouthfeel wonderful & plenty carbonation. Best DIPA I have had, so easy to drink it is scary. Thanks to Bruce & Rick for leaving this on my porch, like a gift from God."
"Heady Topper","And the good Lord shown upon the Alchemist, giving them the good foresight to build a new house before the great flood...Seriously a blessing for them to have this in place when they did. How often does this serendipity happen?"
"Heady Topper","Got this beer as a gift from a friend. Canned less than 48 hours before, this beer had it going on! Nose was ripe with pine and a peach like citrus notes. The taste was pretty much the same. HT didn't have the usual very bitter finish of most IPAs. It finished rather subdued and dry, which made it quite drinkable. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy... lots of little bubbles. Truly a fantastic, world class, IPA. Looking forward to getting more of this gem."
"Heady Topper","16oz tallboy, straight from the can, less than 24hrs old."
"Heady Topper","2nd can consumed the day of the release. First drank from can, second poured into a tulip glass:"
"Heady Topper","Just got home from Waterbury and cant wait to try it. Went to The Alchemist about a month ago and wasn't on tap, so this is my first Topper. Yes my first few sips were from the can..."
"Heady Topper","My thoughts go out to the whole Alchemist crew! It is with this in mind that I raise one of the 72 cans that I just bought! Drank straight from the can!"
"Heady Topper","Drank stright from the can as is suggested on the can."
"Heady Topper","Shared a 22oz bottle with a very generous friend."
"Heady Topper","Review from notes. Consumed on 12/12/10."
"Heady Topper","On tap at the Alchemist in Waterbury, VT. $4 for a 12 oz. pour. Can't beat that."
"Heady Topper","On tap at The Alchemist, 8/1/11. Several 12 oz. pours were enjoyed at a bargain of $4 each. This goes down so easy."
"Heady Topper","A-As the bartender passes me my first glass I am amazed at the beautiful orange hue of the beer. The creamy head retains incredibly well and laces the whole glass. Just a perfect look."
"Heady Topper","Tap at The Alchemist (mutliple times over two days)"
"Heady Topper","Tasted on 7/18"
"Heady Topper","After hearing so much about it and enjoying a visit to the Alchemist last fall when it was not on-tap, I finally got to try Heady Topper the evening before the Vermont Brewers Festival."
"Heady Topper","First had a taste of this at the VBF 2011. Liked it so much we made our way out to Waterbury for dinner @ The Alchemist Pub on Sunday night. Had four of these with dinner (including one on Cask) along with some other really excellent beers."
"Heady Topper","On cask at the alchemist! 12oz. pour in a smaller tapered pint glass."
"Heady Topper","Review from multiple pours at VBF."
"Heady Topper","On tap at The Alchemist "
"Heady Topper","Heady Topper is a treat in and of itself. The Alchemist in Waterbury, VT has been producing wonderful elixers for years, but I personally believe brewed perfection with this IPA. The hoppy aroma just wafts itself in your direction, giving you goosebumps as you anticipate your first sip. "
"Heady Topper","Pours a nice dark copper/orange with a thin fizzy head. Nice ring of lacing leaves blotchy chunks on the glass."
"Heady Topper","Look forward to this being canned."
"Heady Topper","22oz, thanks to ygtbsm94. "
"Heady Topper","Had on tap at the Alchemist."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a tulip glass at the Alchemist"
"Heady Topper","The Heady Topper from Alchemist. I had this on tap at the brewpub and was very eager to finally have gotten a chance to experience this beer. This beer is awesome in so many ways. First its great to see an east coast brewery making a super hoppy beer. The aroma is piney/citrusy hops that blast your face(but in a good way). The taste has a nice malt backbone to help let the hops shine but not destroy you. A really excellent beer from a great brewpub. "
"Heady Topper","Bottle consumed a few months back."
"Heady Topper","Had on tap at the brewpub in Waterbury. I made the half hour trip to try this well reviewed beer and it mostly lived up to the hype. Nose was almost overwhelmingly floral, taste was well balanced between the hop and malt flavors compared to most IIPAs that I've sampled. Am looking forward to the cans to come later this year."
"Heady Topper","A: Golden straw colored with an unfiltered haze. 2-finger head and great lacing. Poured on-tap into a 12oz. glass."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Thorpe429 for supplying the bottle. Sampled just a couple weeks after bottling and poured into a Darkness snifter (being a glassware fanatic, I was quite envious when I noticed that Mike possessed the official Heady Topper glass, bastard, but very cool)"
"Heady Topper","Thanks Sammy for getting this bottle into Ontario! Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head. Lots of lacing coats the side of my glass. Some hop floaties in the beer, which I think just adds to this. I can smell the hops before I even lift the glass off the table. Lots of resiny pine and citrus hops in the aroma. Very nice bitterness, but there seems to be a malt balance as well. This is certainly one of my favourites."
"Heady Topper","An exceptional IPA from John Kimmich in Waterbury. The heady is about perfect from start to finish. It's slightly cloudy just after pour. You can smell the floral aroma from about 1 foot away. Some IPA's can overpower with hops but this one is all about balance and subtly. They will be releasing the heady in cans late April. I hope they keep the same magic from the tap to the can."
"Heady Topper","Appearance: A hazy dark copper with whispy thin white lacing and a thin head."
"Heady Topper","Very impressive DIPA. The hop aromas, very C-hop, are very satisfying and very fresh as if I am at the brewery now , as if hand bottled. Great lacing and head. Unfiltered look and taste, a full mouthfull. A little astringent. Grea carbonation. Bottle from Fred."
"Heady Topper","Had on tap from a freshly tapped keg at the Alchemist Pub and Brewery in Waterbury, VT. Served in a 12 oz glass. "
"Heady Topper","Bottle in trade with Glouglouburp. Thanks! Pours a hazy amber color with a big white head and nice lacing. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit hops. Medium on the palate with average carbonation. Excellent citrus hop flavor with a nice malt balance and a nice bitter hop finish. Very similar to some west coast DIPAs I have had the pleasure to try. A very good beer."
"Heady Topper","got this one in a trade with freud. huge thanks man!"
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to baconsausage for shipping this towards the Arctic Circle along with a slate of other great beers. The IPA fiend in me has really been looking forward to this one. 22 oz. bottle split into two pint glasses, with the floaties & several ounces left for later potential rumination."
"Heady Topper","Wow. Thanks to Sideswipe for giving me this beer for free. Shared with my roomate pipmeister here on BA."
"Heady Topper","Split w/ bbb099. Thanks to scottfrie for this one! Consumed on 12/17/10."
"Heady Topper","I've had Heady Topper many times at either the pub or the VT Brewers Fest. None of those occasions really allowed me to do a review. Recently, a friend moved to VT and got me a special release bottle of this wonderful beer."
"Heady Topper","At Kuhnhenn winter solstice (thanks to whomever shared this!)"
"Heady Topper","Had on tap at the 12/4/10 bottle release at the Alchemist. Reviewing from notes."
"Heady Topper","Thank you, thank you, thank you profusely to akorsak for sharing this great beer with me last night 1/9/11. Poured slightly cool into a cervoise glass."
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed last night as the first in a multi beer tasting in a small (8-10oz) snifter, split with multiple friends, last couple ounces left in the bottle still had some hop flakes and yeasty dregs in it."
"Heady Topper","Reviewed from notes over Christmas break. Many thanks to the sister-in-law for making our Christmas amazing with this surprise under the tree!"
"Heady Topper","Got a bottle in trade from beerometer, enjoyed with Jwiss22, from my notes for once..."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks goes out to eggplantwiz for grabbing me this bottle. "
"Heady Topper","Had this on tap at the Alchemist about two months ago."
"Heady Topper","Like the label says, drink fresh. The first bottle, enjoyed within 24 hours of release was a joy and virtually the same as on draft."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Sean Lawson for the bottle."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to sisuspeed for this bottle."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to KristinCooks for this one in a trade! I'm enjoying this while pre-gaming for a Phish show - my first Heady Topper and my first Phish show... I'm officially a ... hippie?"
"Heady Topper","Better than Pliny, eh? We'll see."
"Heady Topper","Bottle. Pours a light amber straw yellow color with a slight white head. Some sediment floating around. Danky type aroma of citrus and some pine type notes, some onion as well. Some lace. Medium mouthfeel. Slighlty sweet taste with a strong hop bitter flavor. Lingering bitterness. Does it live up to the hype? Hmm, it's decent but nothing that I think warrants the hype that it gets."
"Heady Topper","Thanks Alex for sharing this one, you generous SOB. "
"Heady Topper","22oz. bottle re-reviewed. Thanks to Richard."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Steve for sending this out. "
"Heady Topper","Pours a weak gold with tons of sediment and a dense head that lingers through the whole glass."
"Heady Topper","Completely unfiltered with tons of yeasty delicious sediment. An off copper translucent with a small white head."
"Heady Topper","Props to Masterhomebrewer for hooking me up with this in a trade!"
"Heady Topper","Bottle into my Narke tulip...Medium copper, not bright or sparkly enough for me. Tope head pretty good, looks good, nice retention and lacing...Aroma is really malty, lots of caramel, great to balance out the hops and alcohol. Hop presence is huge though, really good...The taste is also really malty, very different and unique for a dipa, but great to mask the hops and make it drinkable. Hops are more there in the feel."
"Heady Topper","This is a great beer, and a gold mine for hop heads! Thanks to TCassel1 (Todd) for the trade for this!"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Alex for sharing this one, again. He had shared one with me before, but I was drunk and kept falling asleep and don't feel like a review based on that experience would do this justice."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Kelp for hooking me up with a few bottles of this Vermont jewel! I have had this beer some years ago on tap at The Alchemist but that was before my reviewing days. Let's see how they did trying to capture the hop magic of this one in a bottle."
"Heady Topper","Many thanks to a very generous BA for the opportunity to try this one, 22oz bomber."
"Heady Topper","22oz bomber poured into snifter. Thanks goes to Alex for this one, you be da man. Been looking forward to this tick for a while. "
"Heady Topper","Poured from 500 ml bottle into a Heady Topper becker."
"Heady Topper","I got 2 bottles of this courtesy of Kelp, thanks a ton Jeremy. I had a preview at the Kuhnhenn Winter Solstice too, so I was really looking forward to opening these."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to ubrewidrink and jedwards for the opportunity to try this bad boy."
"Heady Topper","Special thanks to Dreadnaught33 (aka. Jonathan) for bringing this beer to a tasting. I was really looking forward to this!"
"Heady Topper","Courtesy of mmtroop1218, much appreciated."
"Heady Topper","Bottle shared by Joe - thanks!"
"Heady Topper","My favorite beer hands down. My buddy and I compare every double ipa we have to this one ( and regular ipas to their holy cow) and we've found nothing that surpasses either of them. Hopefully their bottle run was a sneak preview. If they truly start canning, everyone outside of new england is in for a treat."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to masterhomebrewer to try this beer. I really wanted to compare it to PtY"
"Heady Topper","22oz bottle, huge thanks to nathanjohnson."
"Heady Topper","Finally, the legendary Heady Topper arrives in California. Sent to me courtesy of rowingbrewer. Huge thanks Mark!"
"Heady Topper","So excited that I got my hands on this. Pours a dark amber/orange with a frothy head and bubbles of all sizes. Good retention and some lacing. Smell is excellent, dominated by pink grapefruit, powerdy pine, and vines. Beautiful. Taste accomplishes what the bottle said was the goal: amazing complexity. Reminds me a bit of Mikkeller Ten in that you can find almost every hop flavor in the taste. Waves of different hops flow and ends with a biscuity malt finish, then hops linger for days in the aftertaste. Moderate bitterness but intense hoppiness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and medium-light bodied. Drinkability is ridiculous and I could have glass after glass, zero etoh."
"Heady Topper","Bottle shared with the dirty south crew!"
"Heady Topper","Bottle received in a trade with DNICE55. Thank you, David."
"Heady Topper","HUGE thanks to Brian for sending this my way!"
"Heady Topper","Pours a slightly hazy copper-orange with a fingers worth of white foamy head on top. Leaves waves of lacing down the pint glass."
"Heady Topper","Poured into a Heady Topper pint glass, revealing hazy caramel body under a few fingers of thick white head. Some lacing. Smells deliciously hoppy with an unctuous meaty caramel malt backbone. Lots of sweet honey floral smell. Holding up well post-release."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a bottle on 12/18/10 (bottle was acquired at the Dec. 4th Heady release)."
"Heady Topper","A hazy gold with a frothy head and nice lacing"
"Heady Topper","Had on tap the day of the 600 bottle release"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to beerometer for making his first trade ever with such an awesome beer. Served in my Stone IPA glass."
"Heady Topper","Many thanks to mymrnngjckt for sharing a bottle of this last night. What a treat."
"Heady Topper","Just received this brew tonight and CAN'T wait to try it!! I've heard so much about it from a jerky friend out in Connecticut. Now I get to try it! Drank from my Surly nonic pint glass."
"Heady Topper","Thanks to both SneezyAchew and stowehop for bottles. Served in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Bottled 11/30/10, and consumed on 12/09/10."
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to bring for the bottle. Bottled on 11/30/2010, consumed 12/13/2010."
"Heady Topper","First of all, a big thanks to Drazzamatazz who sent out this special beer. Cheers!"
"Heady Topper","Chilled bottle into a glass. Thanks to the numerous Vermonters who showered me in offers of sending this: Drazzamatazz, iwantmorehops, youbrewidrink, and KristinCooks. There are some VERY generous people in that region. "
"Heady Topper","Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!"
"Heady Topper","22oz bottle poured into a perfect pint glass. Pours a murky golden burnt orange color. Smell is intensly piney with lots of pineapple, citrus and appricot. Taste is very similar to smell. Piney resin, fruit taste and a nice light malt backbone. Nicely carbonated giving a thick and lasting mouthfeel. Amazing beer. One of the best and most drinkable double IPAs. I cannot reccomend this one enough."
"Heady Topper","Out of a Hennepin tulip:"
"Heady Topper","Yes, that's right...bottled! Thanks to John and Co. for finally releasing this one. First tried this at the Cyclorama in Boston (EBF) when The Alchemist was just getting started and have had on tap at the source a handful of times. Very happy to have a friend bust out a bomber at a small gathering last night."
"Heady Topper","Very happy I finally get to try this one, straight from the tap into my pilsner glass. Pours yellowish orange with a slight haze, small off white head with good retention and some nice lacing. As soon as this beer hits the table I can smell the hops. This is up there with some of the best smelling IPAs made. Pineapple, sweet malts, tropical fruit, not a hint of bitterness - just wonderful aroma hops. Taste is surprisingly different from the smell, and this isnt a bad thing. Pineapple and tropical fruit flavor but with a bit more bitterness then I was expecting, some biscuit malt (not a lot, just enough to provide balance), a slightly spicy, earthy hop finish. The lighter side of medium body with a medium light carbonation, finishes very clean. This is an excellent IPA and hands down the best one to come from anywhere east of California. Very different then the west coasters in terms of flavor, but much smoother and more drinkable then Pliny or some of the other notables. I wanted to try everything at the Alchemist and this was my first, and then my second beer. Wish I could drink this every night."
"Heady Topper","Bottle shared by Thorpe429, thanks Mike. This IPA has gotten so much buzz in the past year, it quickly became my biggest beer ambition to get some, after having some of the bottle last night, it remains one of my biggest wants. I have to make it up to the alchemist the next time this is on tap."
"Heady Topper","22 oz. bottle courtesy of the generous masterhomebrewer - thanks, buddy! I wanted to consume this one as quickly as possible, so that it would be as fresh as possible (as is encouraged by the brewmaster on the excellently written label). Poured in to a large tulip."
"Heady Topper","Big thanks to rpstevens for the bottle in Secret Santa '10."
"Heady Topper","Thanks a lot to baconsausage for sending me this great brew!"
"Heady Topper","Thanks sleepydave for sending me this bottle!"
"Heady Topper","Bottle thanks to Drazzamatazz."
"Heady Topper","Sharing a bottle of this with mymrnngjckt. Really looking forward to this..."
"Heady Topper","Thanks for sharing this one drew"
"Heady Topper","Huge thanks to Sisuspeed for sending this my way in a recent trade! The bomber was split with a friend and poured into two snifters."
"Heady Topper","I cannot believe that this beer is in front of me. I've dreamed about it forever. In fact, I've even considered making a trip out to Vermont simply to try it. Thanks, glazeman, and thanks to the trader that got this one done for him, and thanks to the trader that hooked me up with Matt in order to reel in the infamous Heady Topper."
"Heady Topper","22oz bottle received in a trade with rowingbrewer. Poured into a Bruery tulip."
"Heady Topper","22 oz bottle, big thanks to grub for sharing!"
"Heady Topper","12/11/2010. Thanks to Murchmac. Bottle. Enjoyable beer but lacking any real bitter bite and not quite as loaded down with hops as I prefer. The beer pours a cloudy, tawny orange-amber with a white head. A very nice sweet citrus and tropical fruit tone dominates the aroma. It's almost entirely tangerine rind, mangoes and guava. There's a hint of pine lurking in the background. However, it's not quite as pungent as the best of the style. Surprisingly, the taste lacks nearly any assertive bitterness. There's a bit of grapefruit pith in the finish, but this is one of the least bitter DIPAs that I've ever tasted. That said, it's also not overly malty or particularly sweet. It just sorta lacks a strong taste note. The thin body and utter lack of hop oiliness in the mouthfeel emphasized this problem for me. It does have a nice hoppy aftertaste. It was an enjoyable beer to drink and it went down easily enough, but, ultimately, I found the beer rather disappointing. The taste fails to deliver on the promise of the smell. I'm happy to have tried it, but I don't really understand the hype. 4/4.5/3.5/3/4"
"Heady Topper","Thanks for sharing this one, Drew."
"Heady Topper","Really nice of Rpstevens to send me a bottle of this. I owe him."
"Heady Topper","Consumed December 8th, Bottled November 30th. Thanks to BA member gamanley for picking up the bottle for me."
"Heady Topper","A - pours a good orange color with very few bottles, and miniscule what head that quickly fades away. not bad, but unimpressive."
"Heady Topper","Here's one I never thought I'd be drinking. 22oz thanks to Drazzamatazz. I owe you big time. Poured into oversized tulip. "
"Heady Topper","Pours a very murky copper/orange color with a finger of thick head and good lacing."
"Heady Topper","Damn, this is hoppy. That's about my first impression immediately upon popping the cap off of this. With that, I should say huge, huge thanks to rpstevens and kingcrowing for sending me bottles of this, the latter of which was a complete surprise. One bottle to be consumed tonight, the other to be shared with friends this weekend."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a bottle from the release last weekend obtained via trade (thanks Dave for getting it to me super fresh)"
"Heady Topper","22oz bottle acquired from the release in VT"
"Heady Topper","Thanks to Jon!!! For sending this out less than 36 hours after I sent him a message about it. Crazy. And consumed less than 48 hours after. "
"Heady Topper","A: Hazy golden pour with stick off-white foam. I want to rate this higher but only I can smell this beer right off the bat and it's subconsciously influencing me."
"Heady Topper","Poured from a bottle into a Heady Topper pint glass. The beer pours a hazy copper/orange that glows brightly when held up to the light. The pour produces a one finger bone white head that quickly fades to a tight ring, leaving some oily lacing on the walls of the glass."
"Heady Topper","I've reviewed the tap and cask version of this beer. I wanted to try a fresh bottle so I cracked one open tonight on taco night and split it with the wife 12-6-10. There is nothing like an ipa fresh on tap. This beer still amazing. Didn't loose anything on taste, smell, or appearance. Not quite as crisp as on tap which effects only the mouthfeel and drinkability ever so slightly. What an exceptional beer."
"Heady Topper","This review is long overdue, I have been drinking this beer since the beginning."
"Heady Topper","Having not logged into BA for the past few months, I've managed to miss the hype of Heady Topper. I went to the release with lpayette just for the heck of it and got to try the beer... so I imagine this review is pretty hype-free."
"Heady Topper","On tap at The Alchemist on the release date, 12/4/10. Poured into a Heady Topper pint glass."
"Heady Topper","On tap @ The Alchemist.."
"Heady Topper","A: pours an orangeish hazy color witha finger high head that leaves an amazing lacing"
"Heady Topper","Drank on-tap at The Alchemist, Waterbury, VT"
"Heady Topper","Had on tap at the brewery this past Thursday. I do not normally give out 5's but I must say this is quite honestly the tastiest beer I have ever had. "
"Heady Topper","Had this on cask tonight at the Alchemist with beerloco who is now snoring like a maniac on a motel room floor because the stupid owner gave our room with 2 beds away to somebody else...note he is passed out while I'm currently drinking a Foothills Baltic Porter :)"
"Heady Topper","From 08/28/10 notes. Had on tap at the Alchemist on my trip up to Vermont. Review number 600!"
"Heady Topper","It's a slightly cloudy.gold beauty, topped by 2 fingers of pure white head. Crazy lace on the glass."
"Heady Topper","A- Opaque apricot, very little head but it might be the pour. Kind of looks like a hefeweizen. Web like lacing. Okay. "
"Heady Topper","I'm very glad I kept tabs on the reviews for Heady Topper so I knew when it was available again. A nearly 3-hour trip to the brewpub on a Sunday..."
"Heady Topper","Hunted the Heady Topper, found out it was on tap, 2.75 hours and $4 later..."
"Heady Topper","Was lucky to have a weekend trip up to Stowe, VT planned when Heady was tapped. Settled in for two."
"Heady Topper","Finally made the long trek up here to be able to taste it in person. Reviewed from notes after my trip, I am finally getting around to getting these all caught up. Served in a pint glass."
"Heady Topper","A- pours a hazy golden color with a one finger white head which recedes into chunky, nearly opaque lacing on the glass."
"Heady Topper","My new favorite DIPA, if not my new favorite beer overall right now! Extremely lucky to have been in VT while this was tapped. Enjoyed multiple times after SIPtemberfest with BeerTruth on 9/26/09. Unfortunately, the cask was already gone."
"Heady Topper","So I am with my girlfriend and her mom touring around Vermont. We try to go to harpoon but it is closed on Mondays. Bummer. BA on the cell phone. This place looks good. GPS's timer is off by an hour. Sounds good let's make a trip of it."
"Heady Topper","My last bier of the night (16APR09) with dinner... The Holey Moley having kicked, this was the one to satisfy my hop habit..."
"Heady Topper","I had heard so much about this beer I finally decided I had to drive south to check it out. Off the tap it was a deep gold color leaning towards amber with some of its hues. The head was two-fingers thick, playground-sand-colored, displayed great retention as a perfectly tight cap and left consistent bands of thin lacing. The aroma was big and spicy, full of aggressive hops and a musty quality almost like armpit odor. I know that sounds awful but I was blown away by how much smell was emitting from this beer. The flavors were equally huge. A deep hop profile of pine, grapefruit and kumquat with some white pepper and similar spiciness was balanced nicely by the malt sweetness of toffee and butterscotch. The finish was again hoppy with edgy notes of bitter resin and some lemon zest. It was almost like a wet-hopped beer with the drinkability of good American Brown Ale because the alcohol was so well hidden. The mouthfeel was very smooth but the carbonation gave the right amount of 'fill' to its medium body. One of the best Vermont beers I have ever had and one of the best Imperial/Double IPAs I've ever come across."
"Heady Topper","Quite simply, it's the best beer I've ever had. I was privileged to be one of the first to try Heady Topper when it was introduced at the Vermont Brewer's Festival quite a few years back. After sampling about a dozen wonderful microbrews (in 3oz samples mind you, so I was still an objective critic), I stopped by the Alchemist tent & tried this new concoction."
"Heady Topper","The Alchemist: Heady Topper, IIPA (Tasted 11/28/08)"
"Heady Topper","This beer poured a beautiful orange-blond color with lots of foam. Not the first cask ale I've had though. The aroma was strong and hoppy with hints of citrus. The taste started out strong and hoppy and faded into a nice citrusy bitterness. Well balanced for a DIPA and as their description says, very drinkable. Packs a wallop at 140IBUs."
"Heady Topper","Had this on tap at the pub in early October."
"Heady Topper","Had more than one of these during our visit to the brewpub. Nice and orangey amber, I dove right in and picked up on an intriguing woody-earthy character in the aroma. There was also a nice new mown hay essence and candied hoppyness as well. That is a lot of excitement to live up to, but luckily, the beer delivered all of this in the taste as well. The earthiness was also pretty present in the finish. This is an excellent double IPA which will keep you ordering more. I can't say any more than that even at 8% abv...I still wanted to keep drinking. No taste fatigue or wobbliness in the legs after one. Nice beer."
"Heady Topper","Had this bad boy more than once at the brewer's fest, but was salivating when I saw they had it on cask at the pub."
"Heady Topper","Appears a cloudy golden amber...looks unfiltered and super appealing with a frothy, bubbly 1 finger white head that lasts. Tons of huge, chunky bubbly lace...uhhhh, WOW."
"Heady Topper","On tap this past weekend."
"Heady Topper","In my opinion, this might be the most drinkable double IPA I have ever had! Color is a nice golden hue, and then the aroma... oh, the aroma. Heady Topper STINKS of cascade, I love it! Goes down really smooth, hoppy, but not too hoppy, totally balanced. I look forward to trying more beers by the Alchemist."
"Heady Topper","Enjoyed at the brewpub."
"Heady Topper","On tap at the Alchemist brewpub in Waterbury, VT. Damn, 8% ABV and 120 IBU's, but totally smooth and tasty. Amber color with a low white bubbly head. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Smooth and even mouthfeel leads to an intense flavor of pineapple and orange peel hops with a hint of peaches. The ABV is subtle and not overpowering at all. A fine web of lacing dances around the inside of the glass. The flavor is consistent throughout the entire glass. This one is real tasty and I ripped through it because I couldn't stand the thought of it not rolling over my taste buds for more than a few seconds."
"Heady Topper","Served a pale amber with a small light head. Hops are the flavor of choice here, but they are done right. Such a yummy bite. Actually does live up to it's name as the hops are strong enough to give off the heady within the buzz. Hops are not overly complex, yet not too simple either. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Served only in 12oz glasses, the abv is not at all apparent. Sooo smooth. I'm sad that El Jefe is no longer on the menu, but I'd take the Heady Topper over the chief anyday."
"King JJJuliusss","Probably the best hoppy beer they have brewed."
"King JJJuliusss","Brewed for 4th anniversary, reviewed 7/4/16."
"King JJJuliusss","This thing punches you in the mouth with an overload of hops. I thought it couldn't get any hoppier than regular King Julius. I was wrong. These will be the best burps you will ever taste. Just a clinic in how to load a beer up on hops properly. Thanks for the growler Elliott!"
"King JJJuliusss","My favorite along side of Very Hazy and Green."
"King JJJuliusss","Drank 08-06-16. Oh shizzzz."
"King JJJuliusss","This is an old rating from june, had an amazing mouthfeel with a juice explosion. Probably the best Dipa I've had from tree house, very green may be close"
"King JJJuliusss","L: Super hazy - looks like a dark colored orange juice"
"King JJJuliusss","Great beer but the hops kicked the juiciness down a tad and made it slightly more abrasive on the back end."
"King JJJuliusss","Poured a golden-orange haze from the can and it looked fantastic. The nose was wonderful with just a bounty of citrus flowing from it. Oranges really stand out to me. The body was just like orange juice beer. It tastes so juicy and refreshing and sweet with a light bitterness at the end. But it is very close to Julius. So close that it's not the worth giving up an arm and a leg for when Julius is easier to get."
"King JJJuliusss","Triple J King doesn't disappoint."
"King JJJuliusss","Excellent beer (Thanks Bob, for sharing).  I don't like it as much as King Julius but that is hardly criticism. Had the chance to enjoy this a few weeks ago on Skaneatles lake after a good day of golf. Tree House is amazing"
"King JJJuliusss","Simply the best IPA I've ever had!  Citrus and dank for days."
"King JJJuliusss","I would not change a thing about this beer. I love everything about it.. It looks perfect.. smells like amazing oranges and tropical fruits... its mouthfeel is epc... a top 5 hoppy beer ever for me..."
"King JJJuliusss","Canned on 6/24/16 and served in my TH tulip.  Pours a cloudy, dull orange, with a tight, creamy, 1.5 inch, off-white head.  Incredible nose - bug juicy notes upfront followed by a hint of pith.  Taste follows nose with the addition of a kiss of biscuit malt to break up the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation.  Texture is smooth and creamy.  I haven’t had Julius in a while, but this seems quite akin."
"King JJJuliusss","Can dated 06/24/16."
"King JJJuliusss","The best beer I've ever had, period.  Was lucky enough to be there when it was released.  Looks great, smells like a citrus floral bomb, hop taste with no bitterness.  Had it when it first came out, then had my last can 2 months later and it was nearly as good.  Hope it gets made again someday."
"King JJJuliusss","16 oz. can.  I am aware that this a bit old at this point.  Pours a very hazy orange.  Smells of orange and tropical hops.  Strong sweet pale maltiness.  A bit of booze.  Tastes just a little bit one-note, but that one note is really nice.  Mostly mango, melon, and peach.  Pushes more towards citrus as the slightest bit of bitterness builds.  Seems like it will become sweet, but never does.  Malty nonetheless.  Medium heavy.  I started drinking this thinking it wasn't great, probably because it isn't fresh, but this drinks really nicely.  Maybe it doesn't pop the way it used to, but it's still exceptional."
"King JJJuliusss","I missed out on this one at first, but was lucky enough to land one in a trade, and it did not disappoint. Classic Treehouse haze, bold hop and citrus aroma, all to be expected. The taste begins pure citrus, hop juice before turning just slightly piny and finishing with a slight malt crispness. The feel, however is phenomenal. Pillowy just as Julius is described, but also a little chewy and a smooth as butter finish. I hope to see this one again soon."
"King JJJuliusss","Growler fill date: July 1 2016 - Todays Date July 29 2016"
"King JJJuliusss","Consumed 7/23 on the beach in Aptos, CA.  The aroma is great, similar to the base Julius.  The mouthfeel for me is what sets this apart, just silky smooth.  Taste is great, big juicy notes of citrus and tropical fruit.  World class, so grateful a friend gave one to me."
"King JJJuliusss","Everything I could ever want from this style of IPA. Perfect hazy look. Amazing smell of a tropical fruit basket on the nose. Mouthfeel and taste exactly what you want out of a NE style IPA. I can't think of a better NE style IPA."
"King JJJuliusss","King-Triple-Jay-bird doesn't disappoint, this guy is well worth the quest to find some.  Starting off with a Julius base is always a great Idea.  Adding extra punch with raising the ABV and hopping the hell of out it some more makes this beer a real Frankenstein's monster.  The flavors are Juicy, hoppy, and absolutely in your face.  The differences between the regular Julius and even the regular Triple Jay may seem subtle at first, but they quickly become apparent after a few sips.  Tree House once again hits it out of the park."
"King JJJuliusss","Of course it's fantastic, but I recall being more impressed with the regular King Julius.  I'm sure they're pretty close (how many more of these Julius variants can they really do anyway??), but at least in my mind this is going to fall just short of being Tree House's best hops."
"King JJJuliusss","Although I may be a bit biased, this beer didn't disappoint, aside from the fact that it likely won't be brewed again anytime soon, if ever. Though the difference between this and ""regular"" King J may be neglible, it's meets the hype. Extremely creamy and juicy, it's everything you'd hope to find in a NE DIPA ."
"King JJJuliusss","5 out of 5!  DEEP orange color with a dark white thick and tasty foam head.  Blast of orange and tropical fruit on the nose, and strong orange-juice grapefruit citrus flavor.  Thick mouth feel loaded with hops, and hop oils, and thickness.  This beer is a true NE juice / orange-juice bomb!  Over the top intense.  Hope Tree house makes it again!"
"King JJJuliusss","Can't write a fancy enough, feel good connoisseur review to do this beer justice. Have enjoyed all of the top beers. This beer smashes all of the others."
"King JJJuliusss","The perfect expression of my favorite IPA.  Really one of the only Tree House IIPAs that I prefer to it's IPA counterpart. Everything is amped up from the base, but abv is well-hidden and so damn juicy!"
"King JJJuliusss","3 weeks old can."
"King JJJuliusss","Had this a few nights ago.  Taste was smooth, little bit of booze at the end.  Very crisp, great smell and taste.  I wish I had more and wish I could compare it to King Julius.  But going off memory I still want and like King Julius the most."
"King JJJuliusss","Classic Tree House hazy orange. A glorious nose with a medley of citrus, mango, peach and pineapple. Absolutely mouth filling with a soft fruity mouthfeel and a balanced bitterness throughout. The flavor stays on the finish for a good 45 seconds after you swallow. Thoroughly carbonated with little tiny refreshing bubbles. This beer may have ruined me. I may not be able to enjoy anything else again."
"King JJJuliusss","Excellent, but doesn't stand out from the pack of Tree House IPAs. Noticeably better than a month-old Julius, but definitely glad I didn't pay the absurd secondary market value for it."
"King JJJuliusss","So this is some great beer....but it isnt as much of a juicy hop bomb as the original King Julius....Still a solid beer but not as great as I had expected from the reviews"
"King JJJuliusss","This beer is straight fire! The dry hopping really makes it drier and less juicy that regular Julius. Beer was great on the nose and it was crushable."
"King JJJuliusss","Popped this bottle at an epic Omaha, Nebraska bottle share. Poured into a teku. Had this side by side with JJJuliusss... I preferred JJJuliusss. Still an absolutely fantastic beer. Keep up the good work Tree House. You magical innovators! I highly recommend this."
"King JJJuliusss","Had super high expectations for King Julius and was a bit disappointed. King Jjjulius, however, is a great beer. The dry hopping adds a nice extra punch of flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel is substantial and perfect. Had with regular  Julius, which is still the king of all these iterations. 1) Julius 2) King Jjjulius 3) Jjjulius 4) King Julius"
"King JJJuliusss","Wow, expectations were high and this knocked it out of the park.  Way better than Julius, much better than King Julius, and Ive never had Jjjulliusss, but this one tops the list as far as Julius variations go.  This is getting into Green, Very Hazy and dare I say Juice Machine territory."
"King JJJuliusss","Mad props to Lunchboxhead for a package that also included a Dinner and TH Bright w/Nelson. Popped the can and was blown away a wave of tropical nose, especially ripe mango. Nose never quits -- you can keep going back well after the pour.  Gorgeous unfiltered dull orange color, slight head, a little more carbonation than I am used to seeing in other TH DIPAs and IPAs. Taste - grapefruit, passion fruit, pineapple, some grapefruit pith at the end leaves a little bitter bite, but doesn't linger too long. While there are a number of breweries like Aslin down here that are coming real close in the juice bomb race, it is that killer smooth mouth feel that seems to keep TH on top -- and this one is no exception. Can't imagine what this was like the week of release. Overall, this is more of the same TH with some variation from the Haze, Julius, Alter family -- in this case perhaps taking it to a new level (or maybe I was just in the mood today).  Unbelievable."
"King JJJuliusss","Wow, this beer is amazing. First Tree House beer that I've had and I will definitely be looking for more. One of the best DIPA's that I have had. so juicy and refreshing."
"King JJJuliusss","Pours an extremely hazy dark orange color. Looks like OJ coming out of the can. Medium white head that actually hangs on for a little while throughout drinking. Good sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is orange, orange and more orange. Sticky tropical hops come through as well. Taste reflects much of the same - like an orange creamsicle with some slight booze. Extremely smooth beer. Another knockout from these guys, tough to beat what they are doing these days."
"King JJJuliusss","Orange juice with foam. Super juice looking. Blood spatter lacing. One of, if not the, best smelling beer I've ever smelled. If I had to drown, I'd want it to be from breathing this. Give me the scented candle. The taste is phenomenal. Super juicy and yet has a very balanced bitter. Such a great job. Great mouthfeel but not as creamy as a few of their other offerings. Hot damn, what a beer."
"King JJJuliusss","I liked this beer, hell I rated it pretty highly, but I do not understand why everyone thinks every Tree House beer is perfect.  I have had at least 10-15 different offerings from them.  Are they all good?  Yes, mostly very good in fact.  Are any my favorite beers of all time?  Well no, not sure I even have one in my top 5.  I am not sure if guys who get Tree House want to perpetuate the ridiculous trade market by giving all high ratings or what is going on, but this beer especially was disappointing based on the hype.  Look at all the perfect ratings, I expected omnipresent supergalactic oneness to be attained at first sip, but in the end I am not sure if I even like it better than Julius.  Very good, yes.  Perfect, no."
"King JJJuliusss","Poured from a can and was thick, syrupy, amber in color with a nice white head.  Nice white lacing and a white collar that lasted till the end.  Tropical fruit, melon, cut grass and lots of pine in both aroma and taste.   Thick mouthfeel with a long bitter, sweet finish."
"King JJJuliusss","So juicy! Immense amounts of citrus of all kinds immediately after we popped the growler. Extremely opaque and looks like chicken noodle soup broth in the glass. The taste is incredible; so much orange, mango, lemon, grapefruit. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had."
"King JJJuliusss","I don't give many ""all 5's"" these days (maybe I'm a snob now?) but this beer was absolutely perfect in every way TO ME."
"King JJJuliusss","About as perfect as perfect can get.  The smell, fresh hops and cut grass, hints of tropical fruit.  Taste was a bit bigger bodied than I thought, no booziness, just an explosion of juicy hops, tropical fruit and pine.  What a great beer."
"King JJJuliusss","Orange yellow sunset. Haze bomb. White head. Lace."
"King JJJuliusss","Can pour; Looks like liquid meal - not orange like Julius. Nose of citrus and slight grapefruit. Mouthfeel is actually almost chewy, beyond pulpy to another level. Flavors are never over the top juice, but all the juicy flavors are there. Finish is faintly bitter. Amazing."
"King JJJuliusss","Consumed fresh from a can, poured into a tulip glass."
"King JJJuliusss","Poured from a can into a teku. Beautiful hazy color, huge tropical fruit nose and orange juice consistency. The best DIPA I've tasted, are perhaps a top five beer, overall."
"King JJJuliusss","The long awaited review of the one and only, King JJJuliusss."
"King JJJuliusss","Fresh can drank on 7/2/2016"
"King JJJuliusss","Consumed both from 2L Growler and 16oz can purchased from TH brewery on 6/24/2016"
"King JJJuliusss","The beer comes in a turbid, super hazy light to medium gold."
"King JJJuliusss","Not sure what to put here....it's perfect? Deep rich orange haze, hoppy orange cream sickle. Perfectly smooth, hits all the right notes and then some..."
"King JJJuliusss","I'm sitting here trying to find words. I don't think this is beer. I think someone just took oranges and passion fruits and blended them up. I also get notes of a creamsicle. There is no way hoppy beers can get any better. Or many beers for that matter."
"King JJJuliusss","Appearance- gorgeous beer.  Light orange, hazy with great lacing and minimal head"
"King JJJuliusss","I honestly don't know how they do it any more. Just a perfect beer. The citrus and juiciness of julius and jjjuliusss but an incredibly smooth finish. A soft creamy mouth feel and light enough that its hard to believe its over 8%"
"King JJJuliusss","So pumped to try this beer. Been a treehouse fanatic since they had only 2-3 beers in rotation. Purchased 7/1/16. A surprise release left over from the 4th anniversary bash.  Shared with fellow hopheads 2 hours after purchase. Sadly the taste was of cheap canned grapefruit juice.  Intensely acidic, lacked the TH mouthful and super hot burning alcohol. Can only be described as cheap grapefruit juice and rot gut vodka consumed in  our college days. We were shocked but still love TH."
"King JJJuliusss","This is not Treehouse hype. This is a beer that is worthy of 5's across the board and all the praise that it is given. Smooth, balanced, citrusy, and a little boozy. I was fortunate enough to end up with a can and wish I could have shared it with all of the people who don't believe Treehouse is as good as the ratings say. Hopefully these types of beers become somewhat more regular with the new brewery but who knows. 5!!!"
"King JJJuliusss","16oz can, purchased from Treehouse on 6.29.16, enjoyed on 7.1.16, poured into a Treehouse Teku glass. Reviewed from tasting journal."
"King JJJuliusss","This absolutely lived up to the hype for me. Take King Julius, an add the additional complexity of spicy earth and dank, green vegetation and you'll have KJJJ. Appearance and smell is identical to King Julius: murky, hazy burnt orange with a considerably thick head. Mouthfeel is quite full and thick as well, but the pop of bitterness from the middle of the mouth to the end make it less rounded than the original KJ or a beer like Doppelganger. Ridiculously good beer though, and very possibly the best in the style I've yet to have."
"King JJJuliusss","Canned on 6/24/16 for the Tree House 4th anniversary; I feel very blessed to have received one unexpected can a few days ago at the brewery; this 8.4% DIPA has almost zero alcohol taste; another amazing beer by TH"
"King JJJuliusss","I rated this a smidge lower than jjjuliusss. I probably should have let this one warm up a tad before drinking it. I don't think the complexity had a chance to make its way out. Amazing nonetheless!"
"King JJJuliusss","16oz. can into Tree House stemware. "
"King JJJuliusss","Thick orange juice pour with a bubbly head.  Bright citrus nose with tangerine, pineapple, and grapefruit. Grapefruit shines in the flavor with only a hint of bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel.  Balanced."
"King JJJuliusss","This really is just like an orange juice bomb.  I have never seen any beer look so much like juice.  With respect to taste, it is a bit more herbaceous than Julius, tons of citrus and melon.  Superb beer."
"King JJJuliusss","super duper thanks to rob, mark, dave, and Messi for that solid afternoon mini share and fresh growler of this juice.  so much hype around this one. athough really good, my exlectations were a bit high on this and I found it a hair boozy, to be expected? really solid though, it even looked like OJ."
"King JJJuliusss","Picked up some cans of this at the brewery. Poured into my Duvel tulip."
"King JJJuliusss","On draft at the anniversary party. The look smell and feel of this beer were over the top. In my opinion they took the best of their IPAs and combined it.  The haziness was on point, the smell was fantastic, an absolute juice bomb and the mouthfeel on this was incredible. Tied with a batch of cadence for the best mouthfeel I have ever had in a beer.  The only thing is the taste was a bit all over the place with the hop profile. An absolute treat even if the flavour wasn't what I was expecting, and I'm looking forward to opening later to see if the flavor improves with a little bit of age."
"King JJJuliusss","L - first things first: awesome can label. One of Tree House's most inspired and artistic yet. This one looks downright serious. Pours a vicious, stupidly deep dark ripe orange. If you thought JJJULIUSSS was a solid brick of color that couldn't get any more... solid, you're in for a heck of a surprise. Pure OJ with a soft, creamy head. Fine-particles and sticky as can be. I can practically see the hops. "
"King JJJuliusss","cant believe this is even a beer. my god! all hail King JJJuliusss"
"King JJJuliusss","Julius squared.  Unbelievable aroma, so hoppy on the tongue it tingles, taste is over the top citrus, best beer by TH so far!"
"King JJJuliusss","L: Dark orange and hazy"
"King JJJuliusss","With gratitude to a glorious Facebook soul who posted a picture of the Tree House covered window which meant they were bottling unicorn tears, I ran out of the office for the 2hr drive.  "
"King JJJuliusss","Canned 6/24/16 poured into an TH Tulip "
"King JJJuliusss","Poured from a can on the same day as it was canned (6/24/16)"
"King JJJuliusss","Tap at anniversary party"
"King JJJuliusss",Wow!
"King JJJuliusss","The King is back and better than ever. Pours as you would expect a TH to, good hazy orange color. Huge nose after the pour, lots of fruit. The classic juicy Julius taste is here with a touch of added complexity. It drinks so smoothly that you do not begin to notice the 8.4%. One of the best I have ever had, hopefully it gets brewed again soon."
"King JJJuliusss","Everything Julius is....on steroids!  Powerful upfront Julius flavor and scent, soft decadent feel, hardly a bite of alcohol, then BAM.....that 8.4 creeps up on you fast!  Probably because I pounded the snot out of it.  It's really good.  Good luck acquiring!"
"King JJJuliusss","Tropical Cream Sex with Alcohol. Dont see anything ever topping the True King!"
"King JJJuliusss","Great offering from Treehouse. Managed to grab six cans today at $5 each. Well worth the money. "
"Pliny The Younger","Not a fan, just never was a right combination of hops for me. Rather have a IPA from Laginitas, RIIP, or Trillium"
"Pliny The Younger","Just happened to be in San Fran during the brewery release week so I made the drive up and waited in line. Was in line about 2 hours and got a seat at the bar. Its hard for a beer to live up to this much hype, but I was in no way disappointed. Its extremely hoppy yet sneaky smooth for being such a high ABV. Its like PtE but cranked up hop flavor and bitterness. I would definitely recommend. Really had a great time at the brewery and was really happy to try this bucket list beer."
"Pliny The Younger","First year trying younger and to me it was just a little more dry then elder. Get Ipa none the less but its way to hyped due to its limits. Had this on tap at churchills pub and grill at there bottle release party."
"Pliny The Younger","Lived up to the hype for sure. I am a strong advocate for this beer. Everything about it. I recommend it for sure. He whole experience is so perfect."
"Pliny The Younger",DUH-FREAKING-LICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Pliny The Younger","Russian River Brewing Co. ""Pliny The Younger"""
"Pliny The Younger","Light golden color with little to know head on draught. It has a nice floral hoppy smell. Tastes crisp with a nice hoppy bitter finish with such a great balance making this beer so smooth and easy to drink that I drank two in less than an hour. Great west coast IPA and easy to see why this beer is in the top ten."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Bru Craft & Wurst in Philadelphia and we can cross this off the old bucket list. 6 oz. pour. Should be noted they had problems getting the keg going and they had to pour into a pitcher, let the head/foam die back a bit, and then pour into snifters."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally able to track down this thorn in my side beer!  Tons of hop aroma on the nose and on the palate but a little too west coast malty for my taste....you can almost taste the ABV....chase OVER!"
"Pliny The Younger","Got Lucky and was on business the last day of the 2017 Younger release. "
"Pliny The Younger","I'm not usually one to buy into the hype, but my local bar got a keg of this and I couldn't resist. (Thanks Hop Grenade!) Pours an orange color with a lacing of bubbles. Creamy citrus smell. Resin-y feel with a touch of carbonation. Taste is pretty much all hops, smooth citrus and pine flavors with no harshness. The impressive thing about this is that the smell and taste are all hops, but it's so smooth and less bitter even than many single IPAs. You would never know this is a 10.25% ABV either, it hides the alcohol well. Overall, it's a great beer. I'm glad I got to try it, but I don't know that I'd stand in line for hours to have it again. For my money, I think Westvleteren 8 is better."
"Pliny The Younger","On Tap at the RRBC 2/14/17"
"Pliny The Younger","If you live in CA, come get this beer. The hype is worth it, this is a ridiculously smooth beer and it wont disappoint your expectations."
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap at RRBC on 2/9/2017, "
"Pliny The Younger","Far too drinkable at 10.25%.  If you were walking through a fruit orchard that had all the best fruit trees in it, and a warm breeze blew all the scents into your nose at once, that's the smell.  The taste that follows is similar, but add in notes of pine and nutmeg to go with apricot, mango, tangerine, peach, and who knows what.  Smooth across the palate, and wonderful to drink"
"Pliny The Younger","Superb, excellent, stupendous, OMG, any great adjectives this beer deserves. I love this and am glad I came out 1000 mikes for a  taste. 2 & 1/2 hours wait was all with it. Everything good you've read....IT IS BETTER"
"Pliny The Younger","Wow. Simply wow"
"Pliny The Younger","This is an outstanding beer.  Although on the East Coast, I have been lucky enough to be in the Bay Area during its limited release.  I have not missed an opportunity to have one, or two or four!"
"Pliny The Younger","Tried this guy almost two years ago and I still remember how it tastes. That's how perfect it is."
"Pliny The Younger","Well what can I say that hasn't already been said. A giant among beers. Waited for three hours in rain for this damn beer and it did not dissapoint. Exceptional."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this in February at Blue Palms Brewhouse in Hollywood.  Sad it only comes once a year.  Delicious.  Worth the line.  Great Drinkability."
"Pliny The Younger","Had 2/29/16 at The Pour House.  I was the first person there for the release.  I had a car full of friends drive down just for this beer.  I was the first person to receive their pour, and the only person in an extremely crowded bar to receive three pours."
"Pliny The Younger","Drank 3/7/16 at Monk's Cafe. Incredibly smooth. Sweet aroma. Light first taste, dry finish. I didn't expect this to live up to the hype, but it did. Truly special."
"Pliny The Younger","Ooo baby. Watch this guy strut. Pliny the Younger's man-parts walk into a room and commands the attention of all the occupants a good five minutes before the man himself arrives. It snaps and yells and gets everyone to stand up in salute, looking astute and respectful as the man himself is about to enter. And the man? He himself is just a bunch of man-parts stitched together with the precision of the best cosmetic surgeon ramped up on the stress and the pressure of knowing his (or her) creation is set to be on every adult website one day. Looked at in high-definition 4k, 8k, retina display, 180-degree SBS VR technology. Gawked, ogled, eyes-gaped by thousands in the privacy of their home doing to themselves things in ways only they know they enjoy. The work has got to be perfect and indeed it is. Pliny the Younger takes no prisioners, makes no promises, and yet is promoted again and again to high legendary status. Some scoff at the hype, deeming themselves too cool for truth, banishing themselves to lesser beers deluded into thinking they still have their pride. Pliny the Younger strips these hip-types to the nude and laughs at their single excuse for a man-part. You can't even please men with those parts, he says. Your women must thirst for more every night, he goes on, waking you up at all hours in disbelief that it's over. They want more says Pliny the Younger. And when they get their heads on straight your women, he says, come to drink from one of my many abundant man-parts all stitched to me like a Picasso meets Rembrandt. And he laughs and laughs, bellowed out from deep inside, hearty and foul putting Santa on the naughty list and driving Satan to the hills of heaven. That's Pliny the Younger. And it's number 1."
"Pliny The Younger","A big, hoppy, slightly boozy wallop of TIPA!  It definitely stands on the shoulders of Pliny the Elder, but not by quite as much as I thought it would."
"Pliny The Younger","Peerless. Had a have to try this in downtown Philly at Monk's Cafe. May be my only chance. Don't pass this up if you can get it!"
"Pliny The Younger","After waiting 8 hours in cold, windy weather, this beer was a great end to the day. Smooth as its elder but higher in abv. Great taste and profile."
"Pliny The Younger","Had in Philly back in March. We had an 8oz pour that I nursed for about 45 minutes. This was the 3rd time I had it. The taste does not live up to the hype. After sitting and warming up it became more complex and really developed into a much better beer. If I was sitting down and had to choose between the Elder, Younger, or Blind Pig - Yes I would take the younger but only because it comes out once a year. With that being said I prefer the Blind Pig"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Monk's in Philadelphia.  Had this before the hype escalated to the point of long lines or lottery tickets.  Just a beer I'd seen was rated highly (but not then top 5).   So, obviously, this rating comes years after the drinking, which is probably not legit, but it also mean my response was not prompted by any circusy hoopla or the allure of scarcity.  I didn't even know at the time that the Younger was hard to find.  I just happened to be at Monk's.  So I write, belatedly to say:  this beer was a revelation, an epiphany.  And I think that's where much of the hype comes from, which is to say I think it's at least partially justified.  The way Pliny combined maximal hops intensity without any harshness to the bitterness, the complex shifts among pine, citrus, grass, the way 10% alcohol could be so hard to detect--it's not only that I'd never had anything quite like that, but that I had never had a beer that tasted so amazing.  Unlike many fine beers I have sought and had in the decade since, I remember the first sip with complete clarity and detail.  So, yeah, look, nose, mouthfeel were all excellent, but the taste--from that first sip through the bottom of the second glass--was extraordinary.  While there are very good IPAs of DIPAs whose ratings seem to me to be much inflated by the difficulty of snagging the beer (Heady Topper, e.g.), I don't think this is one of them."
"Pliny The Younger","While I believe this is better than elder I do think there is a lot of hype behind it. Not as big and juicy of a nose as one would expect and there was such an alcohol burn"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at blue dog event. Had right after HF Susan and Legitimacy. I must say, I am very impressed. Yes, it’s overrated. Yes, it’s west coast. But yes, it’s awesome and worth the hype in some respects. This is the OG hop bomb. Pours a clear golden orange with a white head. Aromas of grapefruit, candies, orange, dank hops, alcohol. Taste is not crazy bitter, there is some hop flavors in there followed by some strange piney smokiness then there’s a tad of alcohol heat. I can see why this came to the top of our beloved RB list and has remained there simply out of respect. On to the next one..."
"Pliny The Younger","Comes in looking a yellow with 1/4"" white head.  Aroma is just massive waves of amarillo dry hopping it seems.  Just massive and delicious.  "
"Pliny The Younger","had last years batch at obriens in san diego.  about 30 people for one keg.  everyone got as much as they wanted, real chill atmosphere with people enjoying the nice san diego weather."
"Pliny The Younger","Good triple, Not overwhelmingly bitter or boozy. Obviously there is much hype surrounding this beer but overall it's a solid TIPA."
"Pliny The Younger","I was fortunate enough to be visiting friends in the Bay area so drove myself up to RR for the first morning of release. 3 Hour Line around the block but very worth it. Easily the best IPA I have had so far. So well balanced, the fresh hop oils are my favorite part, and just an excellent mouthfeel. Very resiny but the high abv is hardly noticeable. I very much enjoyed every drop of all 3 pours."
"Pliny The Younger","By far the best triple IPA I've ever had.  Got two large pours at the Stone Brewery last month and this baby packs a punch but goes down like a single IPA.  Definitely not boozy at all like most triple IPA's I have had.  Looked great, Smelled light, Tasted Smooth and went down smooth.  Great beer, not sure if I would wait in line for hours for this, but worth standing in a line for 30 minutes for sure every time."
"Pliny The Younger","I went into this thinking it would be good but probably really wouldn't live up to the hype. I was wrong. While the Elder has many peers nowadays, the Younger is still elite.  Pretty much what you'd expect from an IPA rated so high. Excellent taste, smell, flavor and mouth feel."
"Pliny The Younger","Great freaking beer! A long wait is a small price to pay for a one of a kind experience to try this beer at the brewery."
"Pliny The Younger","I found myself in Philly with the family for the weekend.  Serendipitously this trip coincided with some Younger tappings.  Had a pleasant wait at the front of the line outside of Monk's Cafe, which was good enough to get one of the five or so seats at the front bar.  6oz pour served in a wine glass."
"Pliny The Younger","This one was a 5 for me. It might be mainly because of the hype and rarity, but I absolutely loved every drop of this beer. It was clean and crisp like most west coast IPAs, but had the juiciness of a NE hopped IPA."
"Pliny The Younger","2016 edition.Beautiful gold with a decent head. Tropical fruit aromas with a touch of pine. Flavor is similar with a rich yet deceptively smooth feel. Perfection of balance. Cheers!"
"Pliny The Younger","Had at Burgers n Brew in Davis.  Waited 3 hours to get this - missing church ...now been 26 years since I was in church....I blame beer.  Pours a typical Amber with modest head and lacing.  So tropical and fruity....but so overwhelmingly smooth - hard to believe this is 10%.  Such a great triple IPA.  What also makes this beer better is that Mike and Chris haven't had it...which makes them inferior beer drinkers"
"Pliny The Younger","Pours light amber and small head.  Good carbonation.  Aroma isn't as pronounced as i'd like, but floral and citrus are present.  Taste is incredible, citrus, floral, earthy, but so smooth for abv its hard to believe this is a Triple IPA.  Smoother even than Elder IMO, malt and hops nearly perfect balance.  Maybe my favorite hoppy beer."
"Pliny The Younger","Vibrant golden color with thick white head.  Intense aroma of mango, orange and a little peach.  These continue to the taste, with little alcohol kick at end, a slight spiciness and lingering hop bitterness.  Medium bodied.  Amazing beer that's definitely worth trying at least once."
"Pliny The Younger","All time want. Had at Saraveza, 10/10 for their handling of this, walked right in and had this peer on their patio on a beautiful Portland Spring evening..."
"Pliny The Younger","So today, I got to try super-rare Pliny the Younger at Slater's 50/50 in Anaheim Hills. I'll put this into perspective: I'm a fan of Russian River's beers. Elder, Consecration and Blind Pig are among my all-time favorite beers. Do I think the Younger is worth a three-hour wait? If just for the beer itself? No. However, It was a great opportunity to socialize with other beer-lovers."
"Pliny The Younger","This was my first time having the Pliny the Younger. We've all heard about how great this beer was, but many of us haven't had the chance to have one.. Some would say its not worth the lines you'd have to wait for a glass or its price. Maybe some would hate on its hype. This beer is worth all its hype! its such a light triple IPA. Nothing like any other 10% beer I've had before. Looks and smells amazing. its darker then I thought it would be. The hype is so real."
"Pliny The Younger","best ipa ive had smooth not bitter"
"Pliny The Younger","Draft at the brewpub. Pours clear orange-gold with a slender, frothy white head. The nose has a lot of piney hops, pale bread, tangerine, light grass. Medium sweet flavor with some juicy melon, tangerine, light piney bitterness, peach, alcohol. Full bodied, lightly chewy, with fine to average carbonation. Warming finish, lightly resinous, with lots of juicy citrus fruits, tangerine, some grapefruit, nips of boosty alcohol, orange, mango, mellow bitter grass and citrus rind. Well, it’s very good, and very drinkable, but there are more expressive ’imperial’ IPAs out there nowadays. Still, I can appreciate that this is juicy and drinkable stuff."
"Pliny The Younger","Tried it on tap at a local event. First impression was that the aroma was lacking. Maybe it was an older keg (2-3 weeks). The taste was overly sweet, which was unheard of from Russian River's beers that tend to be balanced nicely."
"Pliny The Younger","really good beer just like pliny the elder just more bitter and hoppy and stronger but all that said its super smooth still. if you get a chance its a must try."
"Pliny The Younger","Got some today at the taproom San Diego. Best thing I've ever seen, smelled, or tasted. Words just can't do it justice so I won't even try. Ill just say that world class is quite an understatement."
"Pliny The Younger","Drank this right after the Elder. First impression was pretty good. Then I went back to the Elder and it tasted watery. Blown away by that. Ate some bread to cleanse the palate and went back to the Younger. Obviously as the score indicates it was incredible. Pine, Dank, Grapefruit, Resin all X 2.  Seek it out and wait in line for an hour for this beer. You won’t be disappointed."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got to try this after all these years last weekend at Toronado. It's absolutely a great beer, but I was sure there was no way it was going to live up to the hype and I was right. It smells incredible, but I honestly thought the flavor was a little on the boozy side, and after two 7 oz glasses, I felt like I'd had enough. So glad to have tried it though, life goal fulfilled!"
"Pliny The Younger","2016 version."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at The Salted Pig in Riverside, CA. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had the Younger on two separate occasions at the same establishment with consistent results limited to two 5oz tulip tasting glasses.  Clear, light amber color with little head.  Sweet vanilla, orange and papaya nose with just the slightest, slightest hint of barnyard animal aromas, but in a good way.  Creamy, rounded and well balanced flavors of vanilla, citrus and tropical fruit with just the right amount of hops.  Had a pint of the Elder next to the Younger for comparison purposes and I can say the Younger is no comparison.  Big, big triple IPA with smooth and delicate features.  Delicious!"
"Pliny The Younger","2016 version on tap at O'Briens San Diego."
"Pliny The Younger","Had the 2016 this last week at the brewery and it was the best batch yet! It made Elder taste like water to me side by side. Fabulous full bodied and incredibly balanced. If I didn't know that it was 11.25% ABV I wouldn't have had a clue......until later."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Harry's Hofbrau in San Jose, Ca."
"Pliny The Younger","Lucky enough to catch the 2nd keg before it tapped out at Toronado. No wait in line made this even better than last year. It's that time of year when I stalk my social media accounts waiting to see where it may or may not get tapped. I hope to try a couple more times before this season is over. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado San Diego"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap poured into a snifter at Falling Rock Tap House Denver."
"Pliny The Younger","Look-glassy Amber feel with a delicate head and a light body"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at tornado, San Fransisco. For an Aussie, this feels like I've hit the holy grail."
"Pliny The Younger","Waited over 4hrs to sample this almost mythical brew, I was not disappointed. Contrary to my thoughts about triple the hops, this is a very smooth beer. It had a very creamy mouth feel and a smooth follow. Worth the wait"
"Pliny The Younger","Hands down best beer, waited two hours an eighteen minutes for. :)"
"Pliny The Younger","Lots of tropical fruits and melon on both the aroma and palate. This beer is dangerously drinkable with low bitterness and little alcohol burn. A damn good DIPA, overall."
"Pliny The Younger","Super hoppy profile. Very plesent on the pallet. At 10% not overpowering. A good middle between dinner and heady topper"
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap at the brewery last year during the two week release. It was an exceptional beer. I'm not sure if I've ever had such a balanced beer before. Each component of the flavor profile was spot on. Well worth the nearly-six-hour wait!"
"Pliny The Younger","I've had Younger on RRBC in 2014 and 2015. Both years have been great. The malt profile of RRBC is unique in comparison to other IPA's. Younger only builds on what Pliny is. Drinkability is great. Very hard to tell that you're drinking 10-11% abv beer. I've had the best IPA's in the world and this is still my favorite with Heady being a close second. Look forward to the 2016 batch."
"Pliny The Younger","Good beer it was a little boozy when I drank it opening day last year of the release however I think the elder is a better beer."
"Pliny The Younger","This is unbelievable. Perfectly crafted double IPA. Just as you think they can't make Pliny better, the Younger proves to be more refined than the Elder. Imagine all positive of the Elder and none of its negative."
"Pliny The Younger","Had in 2010 when I just happened to be in Santa Rosa for work.  Great beer and I don't even normally like IPAs.  Makes you feel funny, in a good way."
"Pliny The Younger","Truly one of the best beers out there"
"Pliny The Younger","Hate to say anything is worth the hype, let alone a 3 hour wait, but alas, it's bomb.  It is."
"Pliny The Younger","I feel like such an irresponsible goober for not having ever reviewed this phenomenal big ass hoppy elixir. I have had the privilege to drink both 2014 and 2015 versions and I will review it in general, based on both but realistically mainly based on the 2014 edition for it was vastly and clearly superior in every way possible way.( Even though both were 5's) maybe this years was 4.99 but whatever."
"Pliny The Younger","Terrific triple IPA. Waited in line for as few hours and was able to get three glasses along with Pliny the Elder and Blind Pig. Overall was well worth the wait. The beer looked, smelled and had a very smooth chock full of flavor taste and feel. Too bad the availability is so limited."
"Pliny The Younger","Stood in line back in February at Samuel Hornes in Folsom, Ca.  The 2 hour wait was well worth it.  Amazing IPA.    Great nose, feel, and taste is incredible especially considering the 11%"
"Pliny The Younger","Went to the tapping at the South Philly Taproom in Philadelphia. Full blown blizzard, everyone was out of work for the day. The line wasn't too bad, only about 30 people at 930ish for a 10am tapping (the line grew a ton in the last 10 minutes however). Pours were $10, first come first serve, keg was kicked in 19 minutes. Color was a beautiful orange-y gold, head was thin. Served (unfortunately) in a  skinny taster glass so I couldn't get much in the way of the nose (or maybe it was because I waited outside forever in the freezing cold). Taste was a little dank, but with some citrus. Sticky but had a fresh bouquet of hops on the back end that balanced everything out. Was tasty and I can see what the hype is about, but I don't think I'd be willing to stand in line for more than an hr to get a pour. Definitely a bucket list/BA Top 250 experience though for anyone who hasn't tried it yet."
"Pliny The Younger","A dark golden color that finishes nice.  It doesn't hang on the tongue too long.  Surprisingly drinkable, but still not as good as the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","Pliny the Younger on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, fifteen dollars for 6.5oz, cash only for Alex's Lemonade charity. for charity, 10.5% ABV"
"Pliny The Younger","If not for the lines around this beer I would like it even more.  There are some amazing IPAs out there without a 3 hour hype train.  Maybe I wish I could just get more though."
"Pliny The Younger","Had a much more unique depth of flavor than Elder did. Much fresher too, cuz obviously, it is consumed within days of release. Aroma was particularly alluring. I wouldn't wait 8 hours like some people do for it, but there's really nothing that compares in terms if IPA. I recommend you get to whatever venue it's hosting earlier than two hours before tapping, or wait in line with the other hundreds."
"Pliny The Younger","Apparently, I am in the minority in preferring Pliny the Elder. Still, this is one of the best IPA's made in the U.S."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on opening day Feb 6, 2015 after waiting in line for 4.5 hrs in the pouring rain. It is a spectacular beer to have straight from the source. Although a very high abv it does not taste alcohol forward and is truly balanced with a good amount of hops on your tongue, a bit of grapefruit follow through and a floral scent. Had a great time drying off and warming up and 3 10oz pours along with some Elder and Blind Pig hit the spot. It is a special beer worth the effort."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on opening day Feb 6, 2015. Waited from 5:00 AM around 70th in line. Had 3 10oz pours. This beer definitely lived up to the hype. I've had plenty of triple IPAs and this was hands down the best. And much better than similar ABV double IPAs. The balance of malty backbone with bitter hops was perfection. 0 alcohol whatsoever. Each sip made you desperate for more. Definitely going back."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this in 2013.  Waited in line for almost four hours and it was well worth the wait.  The taste was as good or better than any beer I'd had up to then.  Since then I've had beers I like more but it is certainly world class."
"Pliny The Younger","Hands down the greatest IPA I've ever had (twice)."
"Pliny The Younger","Big hop aromatics are the star of the show for sure. Just a touch too sweet and syrupy for my taste. Especailly considering what it takes to get a scant 4oz pour of this beast I'll take the Elder any day of the week."
"Pliny The Younger","This beer manages to do the ""look"" well - pale straw, makes you anticipate a pils if you just saw the glass but had nose plugs in. Take those nose plugs out though - big floral and citrus  aromas, some pine. Once you take a swig, the taste transforms into a berry/pine marijuana  flavor on the tongue. Mouth is smooth, and dry. Overall, this hop combination has likely been perfected, and better beers only occur because they approach with different combos."
"Pliny The Younger","An absolute amazing IPA. Lucky enough to have had this at least once. Is it better than Sculpin though?"
"Pliny The Younger","Didn't think a beer could taste this good."
"Pliny The Younger","Very good, very strong.  Don't drink before your wait in line, otherwize you will be the silly person.  If you are that person, it's ok.  My friend James thought he was drugged, there is a limit for a reason.  Also, Younger is a masterpiece of the modern style.  Check out the current champ on a weeknight and you'll only have to wait a half hour or so."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this beer from the source at Russian River. Waited about three hours but it was well worth it. Younger is just like Elder but on steroids. This is the epitome of a west coast IPA with lots of pine but incredibly smooth! Highly enjoyed."
"Pliny The Younger","Great IPA. Not sure why it's in the top 10 on BA. But great"
"Pliny The Younger","A great beer. Great floral and citrus scents. Dry finish with overall low boosiness. Great marketting makes this beer highly sought after. I have tried it three times 2015 being the best."
"Pliny The Younger","The 2015 batch was significantly better than the 2014, in my opinion.  In 2014 my friends and I enjoyed younger but wouldn't have put it as a top beer, however, in 2015 the experience was completely different.  The floral smell at the start told us this was a different brew. It was smooth with an overall amazing taste. Hard to believe it was over 10%.  By far, the best beer I've had."
"Pliny The Younger","1st keg at falling rock in 2015"
"Pliny The Younger","8oz pour @ Pizza Port Carlsbad during the Younger tapping"
"Pliny The Younger","Late review - tasted at Toronado in 2013. Blown away by mellowness of this high abv double (triple?) IPA. Hops are big but not overwhelming. Lives up to the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","2016 vintage"
"Pliny The Younger","Perfection.  Flavor a mile deep."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap 2015 in Monks in Philly. It was allright."
"Pliny The Younger","Review for 2015, 2016 vintages"
"Pliny The Younger","For not being an IPA fan, this Triple IPA is something that I wish you could purchase in a bottle. Tap availability only makes it taste that much better, sucks for those who do not get Russian River."
"Pliny The Younger","Ok, had to find out what the hype was all about.  Waited 90 minutes and was told I was a genius for going on a Tuesday.  The nice thing is, Russian River only allows in as many as can be seated (none of the usual madhouse, quite civilized) and they charge the normal pricing for it (and are proud of it!  Truly a labor of love!).   Background:  I'm not a hoppy guy.  Doppelbocks, stouts, porters, ciders are where I live.  This beer changed all that.  Smooth, amazingly smooth with a hoppy finish at the back / center of the tongue.  Not overpowering at all in taste but packs a punch at 10%.  Very much worth the wait.  Best beer I've ever had?  Yes.   Easily the best IPA.  Got to enjoy seven (10 oz) glasses this year and I'll be back for more next year."
"Pliny The Younger","Simply the greatest beer known to man. If you can get a chance to enjoy Younger, you need to jump on that chance right away!"
"Pliny The Younger","First sip at Mediterraneo Hermosa Beach annual Pliny the Younger celebration March 2015 with JT."
"Pliny The Younger","Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft (San Francisco Beer Week)"
"Pliny The Younger","FINALLY tracked this one down!  7oz pour into a tulip glass.  Floral and light citrus nose.  Resinous and a bit piney with some heat from the booze, but amazingly well balanced for a big 11% triple IPA.  I understand the hype... this beer was very solid!"
"Pliny The Younger","A beer I thought I'd never get to try.  64 oz. growler poured into a snifter."
"Pliny The Younger","Wait was 2 1/2 hours, weather was perfect (as usual) and we got seated right away on the patio.  I got an Elder to taste side by side, and was surprised to find Elder to be a better beer in every way.  And Elder isn't even the best IPA on tap every day!  Still, I had a great time and probably will too.  Just don't expect to have your mind blown, Younger is good but this is an over-hyped release that owes its weeks of long lines to those who suffer from FOMO."
"Pliny The Younger","Pony and a surprisingly assertive bitterness with herbal aroma and a persistent head. Definitely drinkable but overhyped."
"Pliny The Younger","Wine glass on tap, pre purchased to avoid crowds. "
"Pliny The Younger","I Prefer elder... A little less intense"
"Pliny The Younger","My number one IPA. Its a must every year now"
"Pliny The Younger","3/2015 on tap at the Pour House.  Fantastic DIPA, but now that I've had it, I wouldn't fight crowds and drive hours to try it again.....  But, I certainly wish it was easier to obtain...."
"Pliny The Younger","Believe the hype. This beer is great."
"Pliny The Younger","Happy to finally try this whale. It was damn good, but not one I need to seek out. Perfect balance of super hoppy and nice malt backbone.  Great aroma."
"Pliny The Younger","2014 release on tap at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach."
"Pliny The Younger","Worth the wait, had it three times in one day at 3 different spots."
"Pliny The Younger","Worthy of the hype...the alcohol is apparent but seems part of the overall package that is not overly anything...bitter, but not too much so....well balanced...good hop kick with fruit notes from many angles...tropical comes to mind..."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at a local spot in Palo Alto during the 2 weeks younger was available. Pliny the Elder on steroids. Yes it has more alcohol, but it is beautifully balanced.  very easy to drink. This has an amazing aroma and great citrus to it. Would love this to made more often."
"Pliny The Younger","This and the elder side by side made the elder seem like it had no hops it in. Amazing beer. Super light body, not painfully malty like you could expect at 11% and honestly not crazy hoppy either."
"Pliny The Younger","Three 10oz pours at the RR Brewery in Feb/2015"
"Pliny The Younger","A prefect 10. No 5. 10! Waiting in line for 5 hrs to try it only made it that much sweeter. Dog fish head was coors-like afterwards"
"Pliny The Younger","Just yea"
"Pliny The Younger","Got a chance to try this legend at the Euclid Hall's release on 02/22/15."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got it. Worth it."
"Pliny The Younger","It's gold, Jerry... it's gold!"
"Pliny The Younger","Bigger, badder, Elder. Great beer. Worth the wait"
"Pliny The Younger","Easily the best triple IPA ever. Very smooth and not overpowering holiness. Can smell Pliny the younger from 5ft away. Get your hands on it. Lives up to its reputation."
"Pliny The Younger","oh what a beer! had 6 on tap out in the source on Saturday night! Had my 3 and my fiancee's 3 and they were so great"
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled on tap at Small Bar - thanks to cuz for cluing me into this under the radar tapping.  Pours a beautiful bright hazy mandarin color - much richer in color than Elder.  The nose is huge citrus fruit and pine.  Taste is citrus and juniper but drier than expected.  Really interesting and complex.  Crisp finish."
"Pliny The Younger","The hoppiness was out of this world"
"Pliny The Younger","The hype just got real. It was released from a few local bars and pubs that make this beer worth the effort to find  . This makes it worth living in SoCal for the amount of good beer, but overall its pretty damn triple ipa. I personally don't crave ipas as my go to but having this opportunity to drink it, is a dream come true. Overall it's worth the hype. It's indescribably good, to what you imagine it would be. Balanced, tropical notes, controlled bitterness, easy to drink and so much complexity."
"Pliny The Younger","Had serious doubts that this beer would live up to the hype, but it did.  First few sips started off a little slow for me, but after the first ounce or so this beer was close to perfection and only got better sip after sip.  Ambrosia in a glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Very piney..smooth and drinkable"
"Pliny The Younger","2017 UPDATE"
"Pliny The Younger","Best beer ever. Had the 2015 edition. Drove 9 hours to the Russian River Brew Pub and got lucky with only a 2 hour wait time on a Saturday to get in. Totally worth all the hype. So amazingly drinkable its scary. It almost hurts to say but I prefer it over Pliny The Elder."
"Pliny The Younger","Onot tap at Russian River "
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got the chance to try PtY after being shut out in Philadelphia last year. Relocated to denver this year and fortunately there are about 10 kegs shipped here yearly! Showed up at a bar around 3:45 PM, 60 guaranteed tickets were passed out at 4pm. I was one of the lucky recipients. Sipped on victory dirtwolf and Pliny the elder while we waited.."
"Pliny The Younger","Watch out it'll creep up on you! amazing beer, must try!"
"Pliny The Younger","I used to live on the east coast and I've had plenty of cases of Heady Topper.  Pliny the Younger is a different beer, but one that I prefer more than Heady.  This beer is certainly worth the hype and four hour wait."
"Pliny The Younger","Exceedingly clean, well balanced. Transparent with a light head. Definitely a bit more of a kick than PtE, though not in the nose. Its a classic and deservedly so. But dont expect quite the same overwhelming hop bomb you may find in other imperial IPAs."
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance: Copper/orange in color, kind of a glowing hue to it, appearance is very similar to PtE, no head when the beer was brought to me but from what was there it looked as if it would have a really light, airy, fluffy, bubbly head to it, lacing left on the glass looks awesome, seems as if it is running down the glass instead of sticking, this beer is insanely clear, and there's just something about this beer when you look at it that a lot of time and detail went into this beer and that it will be amazing!"
"Pliny The Younger","Absolute blast at Russian River this year, younger is nothing short of amazing"
"Pliny The Younger","Draft tap pour at Toronado SD into tulip glass"
"Pliny The Younger","The only beer I can honestly say is worth the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","Simply the best beer I've ever had, amazingly smooth just right the amount of bitterness. It feels easier to drink than the elder which surprised me, considering it has a higher alcohol content. I was worried by all the hype but it was completely justified to me due to how great it was."
"Pliny The Younger","Not a huge difference from Elder. Certainly overhyped, but still great stuff."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally hit our city of San Diego.  Had the pleasure of drinking 3 of these bad boys.  Was also comparing it side by side with Pliny the Elder.  Pretty amazing how RR can make the Younger taste like Elder and pack in 5% more ABV.  Excellent  beer!"
"Pliny The Younger","this was by far the greatest beer I have ever tasted in my life the smell was of nothing but tropical fruits papaya pineapple passion fruit mangos some grapefruit the flavor was of the same nothing but tropical fruits and so so so smooth what an amazing beer Russian River the wait was worth it"
"Pliny The Younger","Had it on draft at Hamiltons....amazing, simply amazing...so smooth for a TIPA...."
"Pliny The Younger","Amazing beer.  cool I got some only wait a little over 3 hrs with good company. Like having my mouth ran trew a forest and calling me back for more best beer ive ever had."
"Pliny The Younger","Great batch in 2015.  You would never know it was over 10 percent as it is silky smooth."
"Pliny The Younger","Two glasses at the Bistro's 15th Annual Double IPA Festival.  An excellent beer, and extremely well-balanced.  Great mouthfeel, like silk.  That said, I think the rarity is partly responsible for such high ratings."
"Pliny The Younger","Tough to say what a perfect beer is, but this is the best of its style in my experience so a 5 it is."
"Pliny The Younger","A really really well made and balanced TIPA. The hype kind of ruined it for me. It was good, but there are many ""triple"" IPAs that you can get that are just as good or better. Simtra, Hoparillo, and RuinTen come to mind immediately. Younger might have been the first of its kind, but these days there's not much to separate it from the rest of the crowd. Like Elder, it showcases a similar piney/grapefruity character and honestly if I didn't know it was 10.25% I wouldn't have known. The sweet malts hint at the higher ABV but there is no booziness to it at all. I think I waited about 30 minutes to try it, and I'm glad I got to try it, but probably not worth it again."
"Pliny The Younger","Drinking it now at Stone Escondido for the second straight year. The hype is over the top but it really almost lives up to the hype. It's perfectly balanced and not sweet or malty despite the high ABV.   And the hops aren't overpowering. Just really well done."
"Pliny The Younger","By far one of the best beers I have ever enjoyed. I kinda like elder better because you can drink more of it tho..."
"Pliny The Younger","Truly a phenomenal beer.  More sticky hop flavor than the Elder, but just as drinkable.  Younger had more pine/earth/spice flavors than Elder, and a bit less Simcoe tropical fruit flavor.  The kicker with this beer is really the smooth low body palate cleansing drinkability combined with over the top delicious hop flavors and ABV.  The only thing that keys you in to the ABV with this beer is a slight warming sensation about 5 seconds after each sip."
"Pliny The Younger","This beer is well worth the wait!  It will not disappoint you."
"Pliny The Younger","on tap at pizza port solana beach 2012ish"
"Pliny The Younger","May not be worth standing in the rain for 12 hours, but it is a perfect example of a strong IPA. Think of Pliny the elder, but more rounded with even brighter hop profile. Beautiful nose, and extremely smooth considering the ABV. The legend may be exaggerated, but not by much."
"Pliny The Younger","Lives up to the hype in every aspect, unfortunately the hype and wait makes it hard to taste for nearly everyone.  The only TIPA I can consume with ease."
"Pliny The Younger","Do I really need to explain why this is a 5?"
"Pliny The Younger","Best IPA I've ever tasted. I've had a lot of IPA's over the years and nothing comes close to Younger (imo) it could be my Cali bias but you can not beat the fresh hop taste of this one."
"Pliny The Younger","Notes from my time at the bar with The Younger:"
"Pliny The Younger","smell: like a brighter version of elder.  hops up front, giving way to more hops...residual sweetness.  "
"Pliny The Younger","For all the hype, this has a lot to live up to.  It does!  From the first hoppy quaff to the last, Younger is a great beer."
"Pliny The Younger","I've had this the last four years running and i think its getting a little bit duller each year"
"Pliny The Younger","A phenomenal beer. A little sweet, but that sweetness carefully balances the beer and the high ABV. This beer is very hyped up and very deserving of it. I'd love to sit and drink multiple in a calm setting rather than a hectic Philly bar."
"Pliny The Younger","Worth it."
"Pliny The Younger","This is a perfect beer for IPA lovers. The Younger is to the Elder as the Elder is to Sierra Nevada. (I'm not saying Sierra Nevada is bad; RR is just in a different league.) The beer is perfectly carbonated with such a deep and complex flavor that it should by all rights be undrinkable, yet the mouth feel is so smooth and luxurious you'd think you were drinking a stout or something."
"Pliny The Younger","Had in a bottle at my house.. Hardee har har.. I stood in line for 6 hours on Monday Feb 17th.. Had to save my notes for this to be the 100th beer."
"Pliny The Younger","After nearly four months of planning finally had the chance to do a reasonably timed "" side by side"" review vs heady. While a secretly hoped the my results would lean PiY I cam safely say heady is the superior brew. While PIY is amazing, it seems to be more of a hop bomb than heady. When compared side by side, heady to me seems to be a better planned beer. The only other drawback with PIY is the buttery feel others have reported here which I definitely experienced and found distraction. Either way two great experiences with heady taking a distinctive edge."
"Pliny The Younger","I was very excited to try this beer. I may have been too excited and ended up building it up too much in my head. While this is a great beer, it is not worth the effort off waiting in long lines to try it. I actually prefer the elder more than the younger. I'm glad I tried it and obviously I recommend anyone who hasn't tried it to do so. But next year I'll stick with the elder."
"Pliny The Younger","Drank at the bar at Russian River on superbowl Monday! The wait on Sunday was eight hours, Monday night I walked right in and sat at the bar."
"Pliny The Younger","this has been surpassed by a lot of other breweries."
"Pliny The Younger","Had it on tap at Tustin Brewing During the Pliny the Younger Week!"
"Pliny The Younger","This is the perfect imperial IPA in my opinion.  It deserves a 5 for so many reasons.  Perfectly balanced, great mouth feel, with that perfect TIPA kick at the end.  Hop forward but nice and smooth.  Perfect"
"Pliny The Younger","Pliny the Younger. Oh how I've longed to try you over the years since entering the craft beer world. Finally had the opportunity to try this beer on tap at Lucky Baldwins in Old Town Pasadena earlier in February this year, side by side with PtE might I add. This beer definitely deserves its place on the BA top 250. Piney, floral, boozy, yet still retaining its balance."
"Pliny The Younger","This review is based on my experience about two months ago. Pliny the younger is an amped up version of the elder. It's a little bit sweeter than the elder but I think it masks the 10.25% really well. Such a great beer but I've come to expect that from Russian river."
"Pliny The Younger",Updates:
"Pliny The Younger","this was the best beer i ever had. belive the hype. full bodied, very smooth with a high abv. creamy head on top. very hard to get. waited an hour and a half and luckily was still on tap. would definitely do it again. i have tried almost all the top beers and this definitely my favorite of them all."
"Pliny The Younger","Had 2 10oz pours about a month ago at Falling Rock Tap house in Denver, CO. First time trying it, extremely smooth with the perfect balance of bitterness and floral/citrus, extremely drinkable and crisp. Beautiful rich amber color, and the smell contained everything from fresh wild flowers, to tropical fruit, to earthy. Lucky I got to have a second!"
"Pliny The Younger","Been living in Santa Rosa for a while now and had heard all the hype but never gone down to Russian River to try it. Wish I had gone sooner. The Elder is great, but this is better. The first thing you notice is the color. Like liquid gold. Very thin head. Smells strongly like citrus along with pine and some tropical notes. Taste is exceptional. Not as hoppy as the elder. Great balance of hops and malt. Real thickness in flavor. Perfect amount of carbonation. Felt smooth. Overall this beer lives up to the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","When I heard about Pliny The Younger, I was at my infancy stage of beer enjoyment. I had read many reviews and often thought, ""how the hell can any beer be as good as people rate this to be??!!"" So, I decided to break Vinnie's rule and enjoy this beer at a local watering hole weeks after ""it should have been enjoyed."" Well, Vinnie, I can't imagine how this wonderful contribution to the beer world could get any better, even after sitting through a coast to coast joyride, over many wonderful brew towns in this great place of freedom to brew whatever the heck you want to! All I can say is thank you. One day I will enjoy this citrine jewel in the location of its birth, until then..."
"Pliny The Younger","6 ounce pour into short tulip glass, enjoyed during PtY tapping event at Side Bar in West Chester (shout out to my man, Brendan, the ever friendly bartender at this awesome establishment). PtY was not hazy, as I had anticipated, but rather clear. Slim collar and decent lacing, although both head and retention were likely compromised by nature of event (servings were pre-poured before I got to the bar rail). In any event, the nose was incredibly flamboyant/expressive, with sweet piney hops evident. In the palate, the experience was at first extremely hoppy, followed by a mango/papaya floral fruit note, and finally, a sticky piney/citrus burn."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Monk's Café in Philadelphia on 3/11/14:"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Monk's Cafe Mad Monday, 6 oz pour into a small wine glass"
"Pliny The Younger","(combination of samplings consecutive days at City Tap House and Monk's Cafe, respectively)"
"Pliny The Younger","Second time having younger, this time at monks, 6 ounce pour in a goblet. Pale yellow, no head, poured ahead of time for at least 100 people. The aroma was light pine. Taste was pine, citrus and alcohol, slightly bitter. The carbonation was good, full bodied. I was very disappointed younger, all 5 of us agreed elder was a far superior brew. Younger is good, but not as good as the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured at Monk's Mad Monday event."
"Pliny The Younger","This is as good as it gets! A very balanced triple IPA that is very very smooth. This is the most drinkable and delicious TIPA there is for sure. I have gone up to Russian River the past two years to get this and will continue to do so!"
"Pliny The Younger","Had it on tap at the Escondido ale house. Waiting only about an hour with my wife and some really great craft beer strangers. Beer was truly nectar of the gods. Lived up to the hype and the experience overall made it that much better! Can not wait until next year to get my hands on another pint."
"Pliny The Younger","This is my favorite beer now, just a bit better than the heady topper. This is the smoothest sweetest tasting IPA I have ever had. It doesn't even taste like alcohol. The aftertaste is second to none. I tried it twice and still cannot believe how good it is."
"Pliny The Younger","A: Straw yellow color. Clean filtered. "
"Pliny The Younger","A: not as cloudy as Heady Topper, but a beautiful burnt amber orange with 60% opacity. Thin, fluffy head with a sea-foam look and 1-2cm rise."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this beer for the first time today on tap at the Memphis Tavern in Philadelphia. I now understand what the hoopla is all about. Although my mainstay is Belgian style beers as I'm not generally a fan of hop forward beers, this creation was excellent. Look forward to more of the same from Russian River."
"Pliny The Younger","6 oz pours in wine glasses. Not much but at least a try."
"Pliny The Younger","Appears a clear gold with thick white head that leaves tons of lacing. Nose is full of tropical aroma, citrus, grapefruit, and pine come through the strongest. Taste is expertly balanced with plenty of piney hops. To a of apricot and grapefruit throughout with bitter undertones. Mouthfeel is surprisngly light and had a slightly creamy feel. This is truly well balanced and the alcohol is nearly undetectable. Very good!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at pour house sacto, ca..looks a clear 24k, vibrant tiny bubbles from the bottom of the tulip glass, lots of micro bubble action..smell is pine, apricot, and white grape, some sweet fruit juice as well. Taste is exactly as the smell suggest, pine, bitter-floral hop profile, very smooth and tasty..nice punch of hops without the lingering resinous sticky feeling of beers in this same style...mouthfeel is perfect, light creamy carbonation, with slight micro bubble action on the front of the tongue which smooths out quickly on the palate.. overall a well executed and dialed in iiipa. Food paring is: savory and mild- spicy foods, suxh as indian food, lamb lollipops with basil or mint sauce, or some heavily salted/seasoned nuts."
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap @ Final Gravity in Roseville, CA"
"Pliny The Younger","well, I finally got to try it. bought the raffle tickets at Beachwood BBQ so didn't have to wait in the line. $40 in raffle tickets produced one pint=a deal better than waiting in that long line and with the weather lately, that works."
"Pliny The Younger","Scored 8oz pour on tap at Crow Bar 2014 release."
"Pliny The Younger","Got to try the beer at a local restaurant that got a couple kegs of it. 10 oz pour."
"Pliny The Younger","The younger... What can I say this beer lives up the the hype. I've never had a triple IPA that was this clean. I had it on 2/24/2014 so it's my first dive in. I had to wait in a long line and take the afternoon off work to try this beer. Let me just say it was worth it. If you can get your hands on it, do. If not you can always stumble upon the elder also a great beer and is close to the taste of the younger."
"Pliny The Younger","Served on tap into a goblet."
"Pliny The Younger","Perfectly clear, small  to hardly any head by the time it gets to the table."
"Pliny The Younger","From notes on 3 pours yesterday at Falling Rock side-by-side with Elder on tap"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Falling Rock on 2/22 (and again at Backcountry on 2/23)"
"Pliny The Younger","Had this beer at a keg tap at toronado in san Diego. Three glasses down and I was feeling a really good buzz. Waited an hour and a half to get it with two extra glasses on top. Totally worth it. The mouthfeel is so intense, it goes down like a creamy citrus sparkly firework. The taste is very similar to pliny the elder with a lot more mouthfeel and even smoother which is odd but I'll take it! Had a great time waiting in line and drinking with the people I met in line. Totally worth it. It's the experience coupled with great beer that just makes it all come together for a hell of a time. Any true beer fan should aspire to taste this beer. Til next year, cheers!"
"Pliny The Younger","The holy grail of beer right?  Well, no, not really.  Sure it's a more hopped up version of Pliny the Younger, but it honestly does away with the biggest strength that Pliny The Elder has and that is balance.  I found Pliny The Younger to be too much.  I much prefer Pliny the Elder to Pliny the Younger and find no need to search this out again, though the party was fun :)"
"Pliny The Younger","I really enjoyed this beer. Worth waiting 8 hours? Probably not. But what beer is worth 8 hours? Overhyped? Not by a long shot. Russian River really put a ton of work into this beer and it shows. The smell was incredible; intense grapefruit which I love. This beer is 10% but is not boozy what-so-ever. In fact, almost no alcohol taste and very easy to drink. I think everyone owes it themselves to at least experience this beer once."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Falling Rock, February 22. 10.25% ABV"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado (SF). This beer is awesome. I could dock random 1/4 points, but for the style, it doesn't get any better. This pours a medium orange color that is surprisingly see through. The smell is juicy citrus fruit with a light sweetness. The taste is lots of strong citrus fruit. It's bitter, but at the same time balanced by the sweetness from all the malt. There is virtually no alcohol presence, which is quite a feat for an 11% beer. This beer is incredibly drinkable and perfectly balanced. Far and away my favorite TIPA."
"Pliny The Younger","I've been about the hype for two years now...learning about the Younger releases last year and missing my opportunities. After striking out twice already this year, my opportunity came this morning (2/22/14). After the hours of driving, parking, waiting, holding in a coffee dump, waiting, making small talk, waiting, finding a quick spot for said coffee dump, waiting, taking pictures, waiting, and more waiting....my snifter was poured and the deliciousness was before me. "

"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap in SF at Toronado. $6 for what looked to be an 8oz pour. "
"Pliny The Younger","Being from Sonoma County, I figured it was time to brave the lines for this reported ""World Class"" beer. I am not a fan of IPAs by any means, but felt I had to try PtY at least once in my life. I really was hoping the 2.5 hour wait would be worth it."

"Pliny The Younger","I'm a IPA guy, but my taste buds are over-loaded from the alcohol on the triple IPA's. "
"Pliny The Younger","This treat was being served on Valentines day at a local bar in Danville, CA. 2 full kegs tapped out in 43 Mins. Once again, this beer did not disappoint. A full-bodied brew with a powerful hop aroma and lingering taste. It is the perfect example of a triple IPA. Incredibly smooth. Incredibly strong. Memorable flavor."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Bobby G's Pizzeria in Berkeley, CA."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado"
"Pliny The Younger","1st BA review. Go big or go home I suppose."
"Pliny The Younger","Served from a tap in San Francisco during the launch week. Pours just like any other IPA of it's style; Crisp, golden and clear. A sniff brings about a lot of similar notes as Pliny the Elder, but I get a lot less pine and more of that malty sweetness on the head, especially as the beer warms. Citrus, a subtle grapefruit and some bitters all present. The taste, like the Elder, stay true to it's smell, and the abundant hop character comes right out at the front, with a consistent, malty undertone that slowly takes the focus as it goes down, leaving a very palatable taste in your mouth. This beer hides its alcohol just as good as any I've had. It really gets lost in the sweetness from the malt, and I wouldn't have pegged it as a &gt;10% beer if I wasn't already aware that it was. The style of hops that are used really compliment the malt well, so there isn't a flavor that dominates the taste of this beer. It's smooth and the tiniest bit more creamy than a usual IPA. This beer really has the same taste as the Elder, but with a sweeter backing to balance well with the additional hops. Not as malty as a 120-minute, but not an overloaded hop-bomb either. You can tell it has been meticulously balanced."
"Pliny The Younger","Been. Long time since I logged in, wanted to hate it but its worth reviewing. Had it at Marriott SF drank 6 10oz pours trying it for my first time. Absolute pure clarity on that yellow gold with a finger of foam. Smashing citrus and pine in your face almost a bit of resin, literally I cracked a smile. Drying but not cloying at all. With rich citrus and forest maybe apricots and a deep bitterness that was clean no sweetness. One dimensional but pure perfection not a pliny fan but fing amazing for what it is at that abv."
"Pliny The Younger","Came to Santa Rosa for the PtY release, waited in line for six hours in the rain, and this was worth it."
"Pliny The Younger","A: Hazy orange with a white head."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this last year at Haven Gastropub in Orange. Was alittle skeptical at first when I had to wait 2 hours but it was well worth it!"
"Pliny The Younger","Long live the ""Younger"". This double IPA is as smooth as good as it gets. The hops give this beer a refreshing taste. I didnt think the Elder could be duplicated, but this beer is a refined elder. The bitterness is perfect in this beer. Unfortunately unless you live by the brewery its pretty hard to get more than a pint or two in February. This beer should be tasted by all."
"Pliny The Younger","I have enjoyed this beer at RR and the Bistro in Hayward. It is big bold and awesome."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this beer in Folsom CA, and it did not disappoint. They don't sell this in my neck of the woods, so it was great that it lived up to the hype when I actually got to try it. "
"Pliny The Younger","A: Filtered deep golden beer with frothy head."
"Pliny The Younger","Better than Pliny the Elder, but very hard to get. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Uber, 2012. "
"Pliny The Younger","Stood in line for 3 hours, got my ticket, and had this at my home brewery...Tustin Brewing Company."
"Pliny The Younger","This beer is one of the few that is worth the hype. Had it on a sample flight that included Row-two, Blind Pig, The Elder, and The Younger: all exceptional beers, but the Younger sort of blew them away compared side to side."
"Pliny The Younger","The release of the Younger the last two years was fun; waiting in line with good friends, bars having special food and ""IPA tap takeover."" That was the highlights though, the Younger is good but I wouldnt wait for it alone especially at 6$ for 4oz's. "
"Pliny The Younger","I had this beer about a dozen times in February and twice in March. I write this review now from notes I had written on my notepad app in my phone. I think this review deserves the complete journey I took from La Habra to Santa Rosa on a chilly evening in February. I drove seven and a half hours to get to Russian River and arrived a bit past 10:30pm. My girlfriend and I ordered a couple glasses of Pliny the Younger. What I saw was a small glass with a clear, obviously filtered, golden beer and a nice head. The aroma was enticing to me, not so much my girlfriend. ""It smells like pine cones!"" She was not a beer enthusiast like me but I agreed with her- ""It also smells like citrus and in very good balance. Not one more than the other."" So we drank. Poof! Like a memory it was there and it was gone- it vanished, it evaporated. It was so easy to drink I had to keep the second gulp in my mouth, swish it around and chew it a bit to get the complete experience. I was dumbfounded. ""Isn't this supposed to be nearly 12%?"" I asked my girlfriend. By this time she was done and ordered another. This was a woman that barely got the hang of Leinenkugel not two months before. As I watched her drink it, swish it around and chew a few times (like I told her to) she would close her eyes and ""Mmmm! This is SO good."" This was probably the fifth or sixth kind of beer she has ever tried. The aggressive amounts of ABV with the intense aroma and smooth flavor and the subtlety by which the flavors develop in your mouth which is such a rich dynamic from a hop punch in front to a sweet tang of citrus to the back which completely masks the amount of alcohol in addition to being filtered- this beer is quite frankly dangerously delicious and I can't wait for my next journey in February!"
"Pliny The Younger","I had some at the brewery and liked it so much that I tracked it down at a couple places in San Diego (Hamilton's Tavern, SD TapRoom)."
"Pliny The Younger","This beer definitely lives up to the legend. "
"Pliny The Younger","Great brew, I wish it was bottled and year round. It taste like a concentrated glass of grapefruit and pine. I've had heady topper, and I know this would rank higher if it were more readily available outside of California. I also think that this blows heady topper out if the water."
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled at the pub several times in 2011 & 2012"
"Pliny The Younger","World Class Beer. I wish there wasn't so much hype around this beer because I really hate waiting in line to drink. I'm lucky enough to live really close to some of the best craft beer bars in the San Francisco Bay Area and there's always some place that has a keg once released. "
"Pliny The Younger","This is a beer which, like so many of us beer nerds, I've wanted to try for a long, long time. I am a huge hophead, so this was a nice treat for me. Had this yesterday on tap at Varga bar in Philly for the black tie event. I managed to grab two 6 oz pours so I got a pretty good idea of this beer."
"Pliny The Younger","First and foremost I just want to say that I did not intend to get drunk off younger but the opportunity to have as many glasses as I wished drove me to have my fill of it. And for the first time trying it, it was no less then amazing. "
"Pliny The Younger","I was lucky enough to get two glasses this year."
"Pliny The Younger","Can I say anything more about this beer than has already been published? Sat next to Vinnie during the day we were there. He mentioned he thought it was the best batch so far. I agree. My fourth year attending and it was definitely the best. A good friend is a photographer for the Santa Rosa Press Democratn who has done dozens of stories about Vinnie and his beer. Even HE said it was the best batch ever."
"Pliny The Younger","Stood in line at Sidecar in Philly for a couple hours to get a pour of this. Was very much worth it."
"Pliny The Younger","I don't know if this is the 'world's best beer'. But it is the best I have ever tasted. Hands-down."
"Pliny The Younger","After such a long quest for some PtY, I was finally able to imbibe on some of this goodness at the Bishop's Collar in Philadelphia a couple weeks ago. Poured into a 4oz sampler glass (had two thanks to my wife who doesn't drink beer) - Poured beautiful clear golden with an one-finger super white head with beautiful lacing that lasted very well throughout. The intense aroma was full of citrus and floral hops along with pine. PtY had the perfect blend of hops in the nose that work very well with each other. The taste sweeter and maltier than I expected, possibly to better balance out the loads of hops this beer has. This was by far better than Pliny the Elder - by a mile. Full of grapefruit and sweet like honey. The finish has a nice citrus and resiny note on the end as well. Mouthfeel had a perfect balance with lively carbonation lasting throughout the (obviously very short) drinking session. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts and hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness like I thought it would have due to the Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, so this was a pleasant surprise! This beer was perfectly balanced all-around. It is truly such a shame that this beer is ""very expensive and difficult to make under tight space limits"" according to Russian River because this would have been the go-to IPA in many beer circles. Would love to try this again in the near future!"
"Pliny The Younger","Was abosolutely thrilled to get this beer on draft at the Bishops collar in Philly. Unfortunately they only ended up giving out % oz samples. Still great to try. Nose is Elder on steroids more pine, more tropical. As perfect a mouthfeel as I've had from an IPA. Taste is sublime. Amazingly balanced between bitter hops and biscuit y malt. hope to get a full glass soon."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured on tap at Monk's Cafe into a wine glass for the charity event Alex's Lemonade stand. 2 1/2 hours of waiting in line, good chats, and good crowded insane times! "
"Pliny The Younger","This was released this morning at my local bottle shop. It was released at eleven am, I was the eleventh person in line, the beer is eleven percent abv, and it was gone in eleven minutes.... crazy."
"Pliny The Younger","8oz pour at the Hulmeville Inn."
"Pliny The Younger","At the bar on my phone so won't make this too long"
"Pliny The Younger","This Beer IS AWESOME. I wont go into all my tasting notes because there are tons already. The only reason I give it a sub perfect score is because the hype does not meet the beer in my opinion. Its a bigger version of Elder. But many beers are equally enjoyable to me. Great beer, must try, should be WAY more available."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap @ Wildwood last night. 8 oz pour."
"Pliny The Younger","Served in a tulip glass."
"Pliny The Younger","I had this beer on tap in a 12 oz glass at Bailey's Taproom in Portland. I must say, it lives up to the hype. I believe this keg was 10.5% ABV but it was not too hoppy to enjoy even with the high alcohol content. It has a beautiful translucent golden color and goes down extremely smoothly."
"Pliny The Younger","Had during SF beer week at Bobby G's in Berkeley CA. Had with a PtE side by side. "

"Pliny The Younger","First pour into my glass at Boulder Strong Ale Festival at Avery Brewing"
"Pliny The Younger","Decided to fight the crowds & try me some Younger on tap at Local 44. $8 for a tulip glass. Nice white head delivered upon the pour. Crystal clear gold color. Amazing considering how much hops go into it. Smells of dank hop resin. Attractive lemon rind & notes of melon, mango, orange zest, and some vanilla. Tastes amazing. All the hop characters in the nose in the flavor. Nice firm bitterness. Not pungent or astringent. Dangerously drinkable. Alcohol doesn't seem noticeable except I can tell it's there since I haven't eaten lunch yet. (This is my lunch.). Dry tasting. I love this beer. So glad I decided to come out for it. Only reason I didn't score this a perfect score is due to the extremely limited availability. "
"Pliny The Younger","A: Beautiful, deep golden IPA appearance with a tiny strip of white head. Had it in a 5-ounce sampler at Capone's in Norristown, Pa."
"Pliny The Younger","A: viscous looking IPA with some small white head on top"
"Pliny The Younger","8oz pour at Wildwood"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Cheeky Monk into a tulip-style glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Fortunate to be in Denver at the Cheeky Monk for a tapping. "
"Pliny The Younger","I'm a fan of Russian River, and Pliny the Elder is amazing, but I've always had even more love for their sours,. But I HAD to try the Younger, so we decided on a whim to drive from Sacramento to Santa Rosa on day 2 of the Younger's release. We got in line at 4:45, and were finally drinking the Younger around 9:45. They were out by 10:30. Apparently, some had waited seven or eight hours before us. Three weeks later, I managed to try it again in Sacramento at the Pour House. We got there forty minutes early and it sold out in twenty minutes."
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance – Nice golden color. Minimal head on my pour. "
"Pliny The Younger","Amazing beer. This year is better than 2012. Also incredible to taste this side by side with Pliny the Elder and seeing how much better it tastes given that Elder is a great beer as well."
"Pliny The Younger","Serving Type: On-tap at Breakwater Brewery poured into a half pint glass."
"Pliny The Younger","First of all I just wanted to say I am not one of these guys who went to beer college and pretends to know anything about beer. I know what I like and I know that Russian River has a huge hype behind them...But its the real deal. Pliny the Younger has been on my radar for a long time and finally got a chance to get a taste this past weekend at Harrys Hofbrau. It did NOT disappoint. From the second I got the beer in my hand(4oz pour) I swirled it around in my glass for what seemed like 10 minutes smelling the hell out of it. I wanted to stick it up my nose and breathe it in forever...It was refreshing. Its definitely got a huge scent and taste of grape fruit. Super smooth, much more than the Elder but amazing. Well worth the wait in line and wish it wasnt so hard to get...But I see why it is. If this beer isnt on your bucket list revise that list today! Cheers"
"Pliny The Younger","Smells strong but with a light citrus note, overall smells fantastic. Pours very light but golden with a very small hint of orange, relatively small head. Initial taste is dominated by bitterness but rounds out with a small amount of citrus, finishes pretty dry. Doesn't scorch your tongue with bitterness. Virtually no alcohol character which is impressive considering the %age. Overall it's the epitome of a triple IPA, a dominate hop bitterness flavor that is balanced nicely and allows you to drink more without any problem."
"Pliny The Younger","Tasted on February 16, 2013 (a 45oz. pour at Harry's Hofbrau in Redwood City):"
"Pliny The Younger","An in depth review is not necessary. Attending a sometimes hectic tapping of this brew is worth it. Also: I see alot of people having the Elder immediately preceding the Younger. I suggest enjoying something light and easy drinking while waiting for your pour of the Younger. The pallate is able to taste the beer more intensely."
"Pliny The Younger","I could not drink Pliny the Younger without having the Elder right next to it. The major difference is the bite at the end and the mouthfeel. When you drink Pliny the Elder you get alot of hopps and pine from the front to the back of your mouth and when you drink the Younger you get a crisp strong pine with a hoppy flavor in the back of your mouth. With that being said, I don't think you would notice the difference if you were pounding and had them on separate occasions. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Russian River 1 week after release (Feb 8, 2013). This was a real treat to sit down and take my first sip after traveling from NH for this and SF beer week, etc. The weather, setting (love RR brewpub), and atmosphere were perfect. Having tried all of the top IPAs/DIPAS except this one, I had to confront the Younger."
"Pliny The Younger","Sometimes you just luck out. With a business trip to SFO for Feb 18th it looked like I was out of luck. Saturday night I was trying to make dinner reservations for Sunday night, but the restaurant was fully booked. So I went online to look up Rosmunde's and on the front page it said they were tapping their keg at 5pm on Sunday. Had to standby for an earlier flight on Sunday but arrived at 4:30pm with about 25 people in line. And the best part is that 30 minutes later there was no line for the 2nd."
"Pliny The Younger","Well, had to travel to Cali for it once and for all. First day tapping at RR on February 1st, 2013. "
"Pliny The Younger","I might be one of the few who at least from the 2013 batch of PTE think that it wasn't as good as other beers that I have had. The beer reminded me of a apple or cider after taste. It wasn't as hoppy as I personally would like and it's very smooth. Reminds me of a cross of Apple Cider and Chardonnay and an IPA. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had at hollingsheads deli in orange. Big shot out to everyone at hollingsheads for putting on such a world class event."
"Pliny The Younger","A--Pours a beautiful golden orange with a healthy head and impressive lacing. I drank it third in a flight of Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger, and it retained the head admirably while awaiting its turn (not very long, admittedly)."
"Pliny The Younger","ranked one of the best beers in the world for a reason. this is one ive been dying to try for a long time and finally got the chance. followed the falling rock taphouse on twitter anxiously waiting the announcement and finally it came. tapping at 1pm, doors opening at 11am, I was in line by 9:30. had to play it safe. turned out to be a beautiful day of chatting and sharing beers with some great new friends. the beer itself was a joy, worth all the wait and anticipation. it came out in a tulip looking as radiant as a bar of gold, maybe with a slight orangey tint to it, and a couple fingers of pure white lacey head that leaves sticky tracks on the side of the glass as it sips. the nose is fabulous, rich in high alpha hop varietals mostly of the citrus persuasion. grapefruit rind, tangerine, and sweet lemon are apparent, and a bright ale yeast contributes some depth. it smells extraordinarily fresh and decadent, sure to be a treat. the taste is shocking. that first sip was just divine. I let it sit in my mouth for about a minute, just letting it soak in. huge floral and citrus hop notes. some bready body from the yeast, but holy cow the texture of this is what surprised me the most. its not sweet and viscous like so many American big IPAs. its light on the tongue and very clean in the finish. its bitter, but it isn't a blinder in that regard. its sweet, but it isn't sappy or sugary or thick. I think the mouthfeel allows for the flavors of this beer to develop perfectly, without making it unnecessarily weighty or sticky. that element was just so pleasing. when the waitress came around offering up seconds, I shot my hand into the air faster than ive done basically anything in the last ten years. the first sip of that one surprised me too, because it was cold again. I hadn't realized how much this beer opens up with temperature. the great blossoming. theres just so much hop going on here, very west coast, very very fresh. I am not sure from a brewing standpoint what makes this so special, and why other brewers cant offer stuff like this up on a year round bases. it has a similar hop profile to the stone enjoy by series, but trumps it by miles. the pliny the elder could easily be my every day drink, but so could this. it really doesn't seem as alcoholic as it is, totally masked. wow. I really appreciate the opportunity to enjoy this, and would like to thank the people of falling rock and the crew at my table for this event. what a beer, what a good time! cant wait for next year! worth they hype and then some!"
"Pliny The Younger","What to say? This is the best beer I've ever tasted - and boy, have I tasted a few good ones."
"Pliny The Younger","Had to get to Toronado at 11:30 AM to try this beast."
"Pliny The Younger","Had on draft at RRBC last Friday. Served on-draft and into a 10oz Nonic tumbler."
"Pliny The Younger","Excellent flavor. On tap at First Street Alehouse in Livermore. One 10oz glass. Reminds of Elder but more citrus (orange vs Elder's grapefruit.) Sweeter than Elder, with more fruit flavor. A very likable brew, the favors are intense. A bit much on the carbonation."
"Pliny The Younger","Very hoppy and bitter brew! My first thoughts were Sierra Nevada Hoptimum meets Pliny the Elder. It's great to do the side by side comparison of the Elder and the Younger if you can. "
"Pliny The Younger","Yeah buddy! Raul did it! Out of tha tap straight from ma's teet! - Russian River, itself."
"Pliny The Younger","EDIT 2/10/13: Just as good as before."
"Pliny The Younger","Pliny the Younger is an incredible beer. I waited in line for 4 hours to taste the Younger. The place was a madhouse. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Russian River Pliny opening day (5 1/2 hr wait, yes FIVE Hrs and 30 min wait) reviewed from notes on February 1st 2013"
"Pliny The Younger","Served in a 10 ounce glasses at the brewery. From notes. Reviewed 5 February 2013. Released 1 February 2013."
"Pliny The Younger","Went to Russian River Brewery yesterday to get me some Younger. We parked out back and didn't see much of a line. After walking up to the bouncer, I found out the back door entrance is for folks purchasing growlers only, who could come in and get anything they want to go, for the exception of a pour of Younger. Once we walked around the front, we saw the liny for the pliny which took us 3 hours to get through. As we waited, we decided we've came too far to turn back now, but this will be a one-time thing waiting in line this long for some beer. Once we got in though, holy smokes. Pliny the Younger did NOT disappoint. Less hoppy and much smoother than Elder, it was absolutely the best 10% beer I've ever tasted. Like everyone said, lots of grapefruit...simply amazing."
"Pliny The Younger","Waited in line a little over an hour at the brewery to enter the all-you-can-drink Pliny the Younger outing today! Hell yeah! Poured into a 10oz pint glass on tap. Served with delicious pizza made by the fellows at Russian River, who use their own beer batter for the dough. Does Pliny the Younger hold up? Oh, yes. Yes it does."
"Pliny The Younger","No beer is perfect...except perhaps this one. I sat down to my first glass yesterday at the brewery in Santa Rosa and was prepared to be underwhelmed. I mean the hype alone, it just couldn’t be that good. Well, it’s that good. I am a sour/wild ale kinda guy but the grace and structure of this highly crafted brew seduced me to the hop side. After the first glass and a slice of pizza I was really enjoying life...I mean at a whopping 10% ABV, whoa! 2 glass limit for me. Is it my new favorite? No. But I will never forget it and will make it a point to stand in line again next year to get a couple glasses of perfection in a glass."
"Pliny The Younger","After missing my chance at this brew last year and the year before, I finally committed to making a trip to the source. I waited in line exactly seven hours to get in."
"Pliny The Younger","First day on tap. Got in line at 8.30 and finally got in a little before noon. The place was absolutely mobbed with people so these notes from my phone are a bit squabbled. Needless to say, expectations are through the roof"
"Pliny The Younger","After 3000 miles traveled. After 4 hours waiting in line. I finally try The Younger."
"Pliny The Younger","You had this beer. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at brewery, February 2012"
"Pliny The Younger","A - liquid gold"
"Pliny The Younger","Really late on posting this. Notes are from February. Had it on tap at Surly Goat, Father's Office, Tony's Darts and Churchill's Pub within a few weeks of each other. "
"Pliny The Younger","One of my bf's favorites, i heard so much about this beer and heard also that it was not sold much and that it would not be in stock much longer, so of course i had to have some. I'm not usually into this heavy of a beer, but boy was i shocked to taste it and want more. Yummm! Boys sure do have a set of extra taste buds just for beer! I'm glad my bf is such an advocate otherwise i'd be missing out on a lot!"
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance is clear, light amber in color, with a thin white head that leaves minimal lacing around the glass. Aroma is bursting with grapefruit and hops, with notes of sweet honey, caramel & fruit. Taste is sweet caramel malt upfront, mildly piney in the mid-palate, with a slightly bitter hop finish. Not too hoppy though. Very rich & well balanced. Mouthfeel is light in body, smooth, & again slightly bitter in the finish. Overall, is it the best Imperial IPA in the world? That’s subjective; I see how people could think so. I think it’s pretty damn good, but I tried it in a blind tasting among other DIPA’s, and it certainly wasn’t my favorite. The hype plays a lot into this. Still, extremely glad I got to try this!"
"Pliny The Younger","(Notes from a March, 2012 sampling)"
"Pliny The Younger","From notes: Sampled at EBF 2010. Pours a murky pale golden color with a stingy off white head that dissipates quickly. Wonderfully complex hop aroma, lots of citrus grapefruit and orange being in the forefront. The flavor is big with lots of caramel offset with plenty of hop flavor mostly of the peach/grapefruit/orange vein. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice big IPA that I waited much to long in line to taste. I’m glad I got to try this its a great beer, but I think I prefer the elder."
"Pliny The Younger","Luckily the wait wasn't to bad (about 30 mins) from there you walk in, hand them your money, and collect your long stemmed half pour. Crystal clear Golden orange color was very nice.. Head had faded by the time we collected ours. Aroma was very sweet, piney, and full of juicy citrus. Taste is amazingly balanced.. citrus, pine, slightly bready, sweet, and smooth. Really great IPA but i wouldn't say its the best i've had by any means."
"Pliny The Younger","I waited four hours in a line outside Russian River Brewery to get in to taste this beer, and I have to say, it really is that good. "
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed at Capone's with IrishColonial on March 3rd. Reviewed from notes."
"Pliny The Younger","The benchmark of all beers as far as I'm concerned. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capone's and Monk's Cafe. Served in a mini snifter and a wine glass respectively."
"Pliny The Younger","This beer tasted amazing. It had a very orange/golden tinge to the appearance and was very much hop driven. If you enjoy strong hop beers and like the taste of citrus fruits, I would highly recommend this to you. I have tasted a similar beer from Russian River - Pliny the Elder. The Elder is much more drinkable than this beer. The Younger is very alcoholic and not a beer for every day casual drinking. If you are looking for high quality Imperial IPA - try locating this beer...if you can."
"Pliny The Younger","Had it out of a growler at Bierstube in Philly. "
"Pliny The Younger","I was in Santa Rosa a week after Pliny the Younger was tapped. I knew I wasn't going to get PTY at Russian River or anywhere else for that matter, or so I thought. After spending the day in San Francisco we made a stop at Beer Revolution in Oakland. As we ordered our beers we were told that PTY was on tap. I couldn't believe I was actually drinking this beer. WOW! Knowing the chance of never having it again I savored every drop. The aroma and taste of the hops were unbelievable. One of my top three beers."
"Pliny The Younger","on tap after a 5 hour wait. Pour is a clear golden orange with a tight white head. The nose is light for the size, heaviest on citrus with notes of pine and hop resign."
"Pliny The Younger","Aroma is simply amazing. Totally my type of hops. Lots of grapefruit, citrus, orange and tropical fruits. What an amazing aroma. Flavor is awesome. A wonderful beer experience. Grapefruit, citrus, mango and a hint of pine hops. Smooth and sweet. As much hops that are here it is not overpowering. Very well balanced. Delicious."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got to try after waiting for 3 years! On-tap at Capone's 3/3."
"Pliny The Younger","Reviewed from notes, enjoyed in early March in Philadelphia."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally had my first pour of this delicious beer at the Vine Street Pub in Denver back on March 1. It took all of 11 minutes to blow through the 1/6 barrel and the staff there handled it very well - they were awesome."
"Pliny The Younger","I was lucky enough to stumble across this while in the Philadelphia area to spend time with my wife’s family. I had it at the Blue Dog Tavern in Chalfont at an awesome event that was not too crowded even."
"Pliny The Younger","I am privileged to live within driving distance to RR brewery. Luckily my dad doesn't like hoppy beers, so he drove. Went last year on a weekday and had a great experience. This year I went on a Sunday so we got there a little early because we expected a line. By the time it opened there were probably over 300 people in line. I had 4 glasses and had a great time once again. I also had it a few weeks later at Tazzina Bistro in Woodland, CA. Each of my beers were 10oz pours."
"Pliny The Younger","Reviewing from notes (not that I need them) from two 10oz drafts enjoyed at the RR Brewery itself. "

"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Hulmeville Inn 3/20/2012"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Jose Pistolas in Philly, poured into a pint glass. "
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to Monk's for giving me a chance to give this a try. 4-5oz pour, out of a wine glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Special thanks to Paul for getting a ticket and sharing his pour."
"Pliny The Younger","Well... It took a few years to get it but I finally did and I'm honestly glad that I did. Not only was I able to have the Younger but I had the Elder to pair with which was perfect. This beer poured out as a really nice looking golden copper color with a thin white head on top. The lacing isn't too sticky on this which I was surprised. The smell of the beer is loaded up with tropical fruits, pine and other forms of hop aromas. There isn't much in the way of malt coming off this bad boy on the nose. The taste of this beer is big. It's much easier to taste the massive different between the Younger & Elder when having them side by side. Younger lingers on the tongue for a very extended amount of time which keeps the beer in the glass for a longer period of time (which I personally enjoy). The flavors of pine and tingling hop flavors just cut into your taste buds leaving you with cotton mouth almost immediately after the first sip. The mouthfeel of this beer is a bit heavier than the Elder. It's little bit more oily too. Overall this beer is something that I'm proud to say that I got to try finally. I'm even more glad that I compare the two with each other. I can see now why people like the Elder better than the Younger simply based on the drinkablity. The younger is something that needs to be enjoyed over a good amount of time where the Elder is more session-able even though it's not. I wouldn't decline either Pliny on any day, I enjoy both beer a lot and I look forward to the next time I get to have this beer again."
"Pliny The Younger","I was in San Diego for a conference and I dragged my wife to Toronado's for valentine's day. (she doesn't really like beer). The place was packed and I noticed everyone was drinking the same thing. I saw the Pliny the Younger tap and laughed a little to my wife about it. The bartender said it was no joke, they had it unadvertised. Talk about serendipity!!!! We drank it from wine glasses. (yes, even my non beer drinking spouse liked this one!). It did not have a head. The beer is a beautifully distinctive strawberry blond color. The aroma is citrusy hops. The taste is the same. This beer is the essence of west coast hops but it is not bitter. (this is why the girls like it and other enthusiasts like the elder better). How do they get all that hop flavor without the bitterness? This is the genius if this brew. I favor stout beers so this won't be the best in the world for me, but it is damn good, and probably is the best in it's class. Drink it if you can get it!!!"
"Pliny The Younger","First beer(of course) at the Blue Dog event."
"Pliny The Younger","So Pliny The Younger... is it worth the hype? Maybe. Do I like Pliny The Elder better? Absolutely."

"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Day 1 of the Younger "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Bishop's Collar."
"Pliny The Younger","Had twice on tap in Philly. Really glad I got to try it twice. Went into it not buying the hype, and while it exceeded my expectations, it's nowhere close to the best beer in the world. Review is based mainly on the 8 oz. tulip of Younger I scored at Resurrection Ale House. Kudos to Brendan and Leigh for doing it right!"
"Pliny The Younger","Had on-tap at Monk's in Philadelphia, PA. Poured a clear golden orange color with a whispy/fluffy thin white head that receded fairly fast, leaving streaky lacing on the glass. The aroma was pretty heavenly. Tropical fruits, citrus, pine...very enticing. Taste starts off sweet with a strong taste of grapefruit/mango/citrus, and finishes a bit dry with a resinous taste. It is bitter/dry, but not overly so and the hop profile is VERY well-balanced and IMO damn near perfect. Drinks pretty well considering the ABV. Medium in body...honestly, worth the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got a chance to try this at Resurrection Ale House in Philadelphia this morning, and it certainly lived up to the hype."

"Pliny The Younger","Lucked into trying Pliny the Younger on tap at Vine St Pub in Denver for a 4:20 special tasting this past Friday 4/2/12. A friend was visiting from our hometown of Atlanta, GA, and this was a great start to his trip."
"Pliny The Younger","So much hype for this brew! I'm glad I finally got a taste. Not sure why everyone is up in arms about this one. Tastes very similar to PtE but with a higher ABV. I actually prefer PtE. Is PtY worth all the hype? In my opinion, no. If you haven't tried it, I do recommend giving it a try if you have the opportunity."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capones 3/3/12."

"Pliny The Younger","Had this at Monk's cafe in Philly during a charity event featuring The Younger."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured on draft into a 5.5 oz glass at Capone's. Pours a gorgeous golden hue with thin lacing. Brilliant citrus and hop nose that is perfectly balanced. Taste follows the nose closely. Perfect balance of hops, citrus and pine. Mouth is smooth with a sublime. Bitterness. Overall, stellar."

"Pliny The Younger","After calling Russian River, the distributor, and driving over an hour in Philly, I finally experienced the Younger. The hype, travel, and effort were well worth it."
"Pliny The Younger","After a much anticipated wait I was pleased with the delectable drink presented to me. This was not just some modest swill to guaff down. Comparible to the Elder with mildly enhanced citrusy flavor and a softer feel. Would have liked to savour a second pint but had to drive."
"Pliny The Younger","I was one of the lucky ones to get a glass of this at TJs. The sixtel lasted all of 55 minutes before it kicked. 2012 version of the beer."
"Pliny The Younger","beautiful beer. very happy for the opportunity to try this, and big thumbs up for tj's in paoli pa, for keeping this low key, no pub, no event, no mass hysteria. got lucky, read a blog from last year said they had it, called yesterday to find out it was being tapped at 4. showed up 320, no crowd, got a seat at the bar, no fuss, no muss, absolutely the way it should be. my computer distributor is 5 minutes away, and for that alone i will return to this fine establishment. and paid only $6.75 one tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","Sixtel On-Tap into Tumbler Glass"
"Pliny The Younger","A - Brilliant tangerine color, thin white head that has little retention, and decent lacing. "
"Pliny The Younger","Kind of a weak appearance. Pale golden, nearly zero head and no lacing. Bizarre since it's got so much hops in it."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours an almost crystal clear straw yellow, good head and some lacing."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at the Grey Lodge, 2.28.12, it is amazing to have such a world class beer blocks from my house. Appearance is a wonderful honey gold, with a decent amount of lacing. Smell is wonderful with a prelude to the wonderful balance that this beer displays, lots of hops and malt here. Taste, well...I talked about the balance here and it is ever present here. When you think about the copious amounts of hops added this beer, you are amazed at way the sweetness just balances it all out. I felt like I was on the brink of this beer being too sweet or too bitter, but it all worked out in the end. Mouthfeel is sticky, but a wonderful feeling...not to slick and definitely easily drinkable. Overall, I can see why this is one of the most highly regarded beers out there, definitely lives up to the billing."

"Pliny The Younger","Dear Pliny,"
"Pliny The Younger","2015 update:"
"Pliny The Younger","I am sure many of you have already tried the Elder and may be curious about how the Younger compares to it. My review will focuse on addressing this particular topic. Overall, the Elder and the Younger are both excellent (as you would have guessed!). I wouldn't wait in line for hours just to try the Younger, but it was definitely worth my 30+ minutes at a local joint. "
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a clear, orange-burnt orange with a small white head that laces."

"Pliny The Younger","A - Served a clear golden color with a thin finger of frothy white head. Faded fairly quickly leaving some good lace clinging to the sides of the glass."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Russian River on February 5, 2011. Pours a golden amber with a small white head leaving a ridiculous amount of lacing on the glass for the alcohol content. Aroma is ridiculous with resinous pine hops, loads of floral hops, and hints of pineapple and grapefruit. Barely any malt coming through in the aroma. Initial taste is huge pine hops going into some more floral hops with just enough malt to balance it. A bit of grapefruit comes through as well. Great bitterness on the finish, but not too much. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Amazingly not overly sweet or syrupy for a beer of its size like many DIPAs. Amazingly drinkable as well. Barely a trace of the 11%. This could very easily put you on the floor very quickly. Just an amazingly good beer. Worthy of all the hype it gets. 5/5/4.5/4.5/5"
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to the salted pig for this pour!"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into snifter at bottleworks 2/22/12"

"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a draft into what appeared to be about a 10-oz. skinny glass at San Diego Brewing Co. in San Diego, Calif., on Feb. 14. Not sure the name of it. Color was honey caramel with a nice gray lacing that stayed for about five minutes. Just a tad bit of film on the sides, which was a bit surprising. "

"Pliny The Younger",Appearance:
"Pliny The Younger","Tasted up at Oskar Blues Home Made Liquid and Solids in Longmont, CO. A: Medium to dark copper colored, lacy spotting on the surface of the beer and sides of the glass, very clear - 4.50, S: Wonderfully fragrant, intense aromas of peach and pineapple, a thick and syrupy sweetness overwhelms the nose, possibly one of the finest smelling beers I've ever encountered - 5.00, T: Strong grapefruit and bitter pine assault the palate, a medium sweetness as well as some mild tropical fruits in the background, slight alcohol burn - 4.50, M: Medium mouthfeel, slight effervescence perceivable on the tongue - 4.00, D: Very drinkable for a 10.75% beer, sharper bitterness on the palate than the nose lets on, all around an excellent beer - 4.00"
"Pliny The Younger","The reason it took a bit of a wait to get into the brew pub on a Monday night. Not a big fan of the style but had to see what all the fuss is about. "
"Pliny The Younger","It seems that Pliny the Younger comes and goes quicker with each passing year. The beer has been much sought over since being named the Best Beer in America a few years ago. A line formed at 8am at Oskar Blues Homemade Liquid & Solids yesterday for the tapping at 1pm, and easily sold out to the lucky 50 folks that grabbed a ticket. We were among the lucky few, and always are in appreciation of the GREAT hospitality, service, and friendliness of the GREAT folks at Liquid & Solids!"

"Pliny The Younger","On tap at falling rock taphouse."
"Pliny The Younger","Color was a golden light orange.  Citrus bouquet. No head at all, but nicely carbonated. Nice mouthfeel.  An immediate blast of pine that yields to alternating grapefruit and floral flavors. Finishes with distinct grapefruit. No discernible alcohol warmth despite having an ABV of 10.7%.  Great beer, but not my own personal number one--certainly not the best on the planet. "

"Pliny The Younger","A Pours a beautiful orange with little head. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at APEX pdx. 11% of greatness. I've had tried over 900 beers and this 1 takes the top spot by far. Incredible taste, not as hoppy as i would have guest, but thats what makes this beer unique. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at Apex in Portland. Was surprised to find it a very average imperial IPA."
"Pliny The Younger","Waited 3 hours in line for this gem. Had I come 30 minutes earlier, I could've been in with an hour wait. Le sigh."
"Pliny The Younger","Stood in line for 1.5 hours before getting in to the brewery an immediately finding a seat at the bar. "
"Pliny The Younger","Well I finally was able to try this one! I am surely not gonna say anything that hasn't been said already so I will not go into gory detail. All I will say is what a wonderful beer with all the elements. Perfect color, nose, mouthfeel and taste. More on the taste...silky, citrus, and oh yeah the hop profile is perfection. Was able to do side by side with elder. In compassion, elder has more wood and less hops. Younger pours a more golden yellow than elder. A huge highlight getting to sample this! Perfection!!!"
"Pliny The Younger","On-tap at the Russian River brewpub. Pours a dark/clearish orange with a small amount of head. The smell is fantastic, lots of floral and grapefruit notes, along with a touch of pine and citrus. The taste mirrors the aroma, a wonderfully balanced brew with nice floral and citrus fruit notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation, and a dry and clean finish."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a piss yellow. Like when you're super dehydrated. Not much head but looks very solid. Smells phenomenal. Lots of floral aromas. The hop profile is far less piney than elder. Very enjoyable taste as well. Citrus, floral, touch of booziness. Smooth... Great flavours overall very solid. Jealous of those who can get it more easily"

"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Higgin's Restaurant in Portland, OR. Served 8oz. in white wine glass while the theme song for ""Rocky"" is pumped through the speakers. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado SD. 10oz pour into goblet. Pours a hazy, golden color with think silky head. Moderate lacing. Nose is fresh pine, but not the pungent bitter pine expected. Sticky resinous character in the nose, primarily alongside the sweet caramel smell. Citrus notes, grapefruit and lemon, some melon. Taste is much the same, instantly bitter upfront but unarguably fleeting in character. Bitterness subsides to resinous pine, almost like young pine bud. Caramel sweetness coats the mouth while the alcohol warmness becomes apparent. What a fantastic balance of strong piney hop flavors with the sweet alcohol layer. Carbonation is moderate, the amount is juuuust right. Slightly astringent. But ever so slight it is. Mouthfeel is sticky and a tad dry. Overall, lives up to the hype as a very, very good triple ipa. Excellent proportions of piney hop abundance and sweet malty layers."

"Pliny The Younger",DANG!
"Pliny The Younger","A: Beautiful golden amber color. Clarity is spot on. Nice action from the carbonation in a thin stream. Can't comment on the head unfortunately because of the near full pour (thanks!) but there's ton of sticky lacing."
"Pliny The Younger","First year that I have been back local in the past 3. Made sure I set aside a day to spend at RR enjoying this amazing beer. Had it in 2010 in CO, and in 2008 at RR."

"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at a special release RR taste at falling rock. What do i need to say, THis is possibly the best us beer around. take reg pliny and give it a boost of awesome and that is PTY. I had to knock a half point just cuz i cant give a perfect rating. nobodys perfect but this dam close. also leaded at 11% it will get you tanked fast before you know it. BEWARE!"
"Pliny The Younger","A - Pours a hazy gold with a billowy, creamy head that clings till the end."
"Pliny The Younger","From notes. On tap at the Falling Rock earlier this year. Had enough to go around for me to try 2 snifters ($8 each). Pours a nice golden hue with low fluffy white head and minimal lacing. Sweet, citrus aroma with less pine than I remember from last year’s release, but still - what a nice nose. Could breath this one all day. Starts with a mild pine resin and citrus flavor, with pineapple and orange flavors coming on strong on the finish. Nice hop balance and tell-tale floral pine on the tongue. Beautiful stuff and incredibly balanced with minimal bitterness. Thanks to Chris for procuring this great brew again."
"Pliny The Younger","Made the pilgrimage to Russian River pub in Santa Rosa this past February specifically for this beer. When we first arrived (on the day of release), there was a 4 hour wait to get in. We aborted and went up the road to Bear Republic for lunch instead. When we returned to Russian River that night at about 8pm, the line was only 45 minutes long. Once inside, the atmosphere was awesome because everyone was there to try the same beer, and they had all put a lot of effort into being there. It was a great party."
"Pliny The Younger","Waited in line this year at the brewery. Two hours later we were in the door with the Younger in our hands. The journey, pursuit, and anticipation made this beer all the better. I was expecting a boozy malt bomb but was pleasantly surprised to find neither to be the case. Worth the hype and wait. Get it while it lasts."
"Pliny The Younger","One must plan ahead to enjoy this highly craved nectar of the gods. Fresh on tap in the proper stemmed glass is the only way"
"Pliny The Younger","Deserves it's reputation. Was lucky enough to have a lot of it this past year including the unannounced tap at Hamiltons in SD. Truly an awesome beer. Beautiful pour, color, burn, bitterness, balance, finish. Ahhhh, wish I had some right now. I know some people like to compare it to exponential hoppiness, but to me there is no comparison. Younger is the far more polished triple IPA."
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed at Russian River during Younger Day 2011."
"Pliny The Younger","Had from a growler at RBWG 2010. Easily the best DIPA I’ve ever had. Amazing fresh hop flavor there with earthiness, citrus, floral, and more. The flavor is right up there as well, plenty of hop and bitterness but enough malt so it’s not a crazy unbalanced mess. Love it!"
"Pliny The Younger","Growler sent by joeneugs (the last year they sold growlers-rating from notes)"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado!!! Check my facebook pics for an idea of what the world’s best triple IPA served at the world’s best Beer Bar looks like!! The hop flavors are similar to the Elder, but with a massive malt backbone and pronounced caramel notes. Well worth the 6 hour flight!!!!"
"Pliny The Younger","(had this from draught). Pours orange with white head. Aroma of grapefruit, wood/resin dominate. Taste is sweet with a nice hop end. Full bodied with oily texture. This is a really nice DIPA that hides the abv well and is well balanced. Quite drinkable. I'm looking forward to the next time."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into a 6 oz mini snifter glass at Capones in Norristown (just outside of Philly). After waiting in line for 1.5 hours, let's see if this was worth the wait..."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into an eight ounce glass. It appears medium bodied gold with only a thin layer of white foam."
"Pliny The Younger","First had: on tap at Monk's, Philly, PA"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Belmont Station on 3.19.11 with hopburster."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to Sparky27 for the tip on this. Tried at Hollingshead Deli along side it’s older brother. Let’s just say that it’s good to be young!!! This rating would be insignificant but it is my 50th rating in the top 100!!! What a beer to mark being half-way there!!! Bright orange peel, lemon zest, and floral aroma with hints on evergreen. Huge 2-inch tight white foam with an amazing blaze orange body. Lacing clinging mightily to the inside of the glass, a fond memory of the sip that just transpired. Flavor is incredible...definitely more aggressive and profound than it’s older sibling. Orchard fresh nectarine, Ponderosa pine, and a bit of grapefruit rind tartness in the finish. Coating yet not cloying mouthfeel. AN INCREDIBLE SPECIMEN!!!"
"Pliny The Younger","I had the opportunity to sample this several times at EBF including a nice little side by side with PtE."
"Pliny The Younger","Review of Pliny the Younger from tasting notes taken on March 3, 2011."
"Pliny The Younger","Served on tap at Russian River Brewing the day after the Super Bowl. I'll be honest, it was just too big for me and I LIKE big beers but there was just too much going on. It is still a fantastic beer but I found myself getting through my ordering other RR offerings after finishing my 10oz. pour. I'm glad I tried it but didn't think that it was worth elbowing my way through the crowds."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this beer a couple of times at tappings throughout the Philadelphia area."
"Pliny The Younger","12 oz. pour at Apex PDX first anniversary party 5.7.11, $8.50."
"Pliny The Younger","Had an 8oz pour just like the previous reviewer and from the Eastside in Olympia. I thought the beer was pretty good. Good frontal, and finishing hoppy taste with a light malty taste. The Pliny was several months old so I am sure this affected the taste quite a bit since Russian River does say it has to be fresh, so probably not as hoppy and nice as a fresh Pliny the Elder. Regardless of the freshness I still thought the beer was better than almost any IPAs, double IPAs I have tried. And the Sanctification was really good btw."
"Pliny The Younger","I have to say I was very skeptical about this one. I've been to the RRBC several times, and overall arn't a big fan of too many of their beers, including the elder (OK, imo). Maybe it was the waiting in line on a warm california day that makes you appreciated a cold beer more, but I have to say that for the most part the hype is true. I agree with the prev reviewer, it's 11%, and you can't taste the alcohol AT ALL. This a truely DANGEROUS BEER. The best description that I could come up with at the time was that you take the Elder and add the subtle, yet complex taste of a Belgian and this is what you get. I'm not a big IPA fan, but this one is definitely the exception (and I've tried a lot of IPA's looking for one I like, but so far this one is IT)."
"Pliny The Younger","Yep, it's good... I had a YOUNGER and Elder side-by-sde. Younger was in a Tulip and Elder was in a snifter "
"Pliny The Younger","Had this one in early March on tap at Stone Brewery in Escondido. I had no idea that I was in for such a pleasant surprise on my first visit to Stone. I had one glass on my way down to San Diego when it wasn't on the menu yet. I decided to stop by on my way back the next day to see if they still had any. It was on the menu now so I quaffed three servings of the stuff. Needless to say, I liked it."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capone's served in a 6oz snifter. Big shout out to Matt Capone and employees for putting on an amazingly smooth release!"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into an 8oz tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","For my first BA review, I humble myself in the presence of PtY. I realize giving a perfect score is a dangerous move, but it truly represents my experience and what the beer deserves as an example of the style. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had a 5.5oz serving in a small snifter at Capone's in PA. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had at Capone's at yesterday's Russian River Fest.Frankly, had come just to check off PTY from my wish list after many years of wondering. Fortunate to get four 5.5oz servings, and transfered 3 to a decent size tulip glass. My wife insisted on having 1 for herself. This might have been ""sharing the love"" a bit too far."
"Pliny The Younger","A - Striking honey colored amber. Wasn't expecting the look of this beer to be as beautiful it was."
"Pliny The Younger","I had this on-tap at Capone's, poured into a goblet."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into a 6 oz mini snifter glass at Capones in Norristown. After waiting in line for 1.5 hours, let's see if this was worth the wait..."
"Pliny The Younger","I will change the score when I find a better beer. I enjoyed this beer because it was sooo similar to pliny the elder, yet bigger in every way possible. the malts were not prominent and the hops smashed the pallet but in a very gentle way. The bar went crazy when they ran out. I am grateful for the people who were there early and appreciate the beer. I will be around next year."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into a 10oz goblet. "
"Pliny The Younger","Tap at PtY 2011 release. "
"Pliny The Younger","On draught at Oskar Blue's Liquids and Solids in Longmont, Co. Poured into an 8oz snifter."
"Pliny The Younger","The beer pours with a small but solid head with a good effervescence. The beer couldn't smell more like pine, just wonderful like walking in a pinewood forest. I love aromatic beers and I could smell this one five feet away when the growler was opened. This is one of the driest hoppy beers I have ever tried, and now I fear I am going to crave it constantly. The beer is bracingly bitter and piney with some great complimentary mango and very mild citrus flavors that lend a hand in the complexity, this is not to say that the fruit notes sweeten the beer at all. There is just not a trace of the huge alcohol , just one remarkably well put together beer."
"Pliny The Younger","2/15/11 on-tab at San Diego Brewing Co"
"Pliny The Younger","16 oz pour on tap at hollingshead deli in orange county. Waited in line for 2 hours at 8 am in the morning on a monday was well worth it. Drank side by side with a PtE"
"Pliny The Younger","Served at Blue Dog Tavern on 3/13. Thanks to the great people there who had such an efficient ticket system in place for the beer! "
"Pliny The Younger","I made a 2 hour road trip to Russian River a few days before the 2 week pouring ""window"" ended, in hopes of tasing the legend. I landed in the brewery by early afternoon and easily found a barstool. Score!"
"Pliny The Younger","Got an amazing tip, shared with a few with Brendan (afksports) and had a bunch of it...finally a beer that lives up to the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","Notes for later review when I'm on a computer: "
"Pliny The Younger","After trying the Elder and blind pig and being massively underwhelmed, I was not expecting much from this beer. What an incredible surprise. "
"Pliny The Younger","On Tap at the Blue Dog in Chalfont PA on 3/13/11- thanks to a thoughtful ticket system that also benefited a couple worthy charities. Kudos, Blue Dog!! Served in a Tulip Glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on 2011-03-12 at The Drafting Room. It wasn't a mad rush at the bar as the owner had thoughtfully arranged a way for folks to get tickets ahead of the event. Well done sir.  "
"Pliny The Younger","This is an amazing beer, there's not much to say that hasn't been said. I though in all honesty don't feel it's the greatest thing EVER. As you would assume it to be from all the hype. But the Russian River crew has again produced another gem to treat us eager beer drinkers with. OK OK the beer..."
"Pliny The Younger","I am lucky enough to work at a place called Hopmonk Tavern in Sonoma, CA. The owner Dean Biersch bought the last keg of Pliny the Younger for the year about 2 weeks ago. Two days ago, Tuesday March 8th we tapped the last keg of the Younger in the county. Guess who had to work all night? By the time I got off 7 hours later, there was so little left in the keg that it weighed as much as the empties. Nonetheless, I got a full 12 oz glass with Kary, our head chef."
"Pliny The Younger","On Tap @ Father's Office Santa Monica 2/11(From memory)"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into an eight ounce glass. It appears medium bodied gold with only a thin layer of white foam."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to Scoats and his Grey Lodge Pub for the special offering. I enjoyed my own pour and shared half of my sister's (thank goodness for diets) with another friend, Marty."
"Pliny The Younger","The chase is over and let the hype finally have some perspective. My finish line was a newer joint in NW Denver called Hops and Pie. A little place that does two things great: pizza and craft brews! No fiasco, no attitude, and no worries. Hops and Pie poured off their 5.5 gallon of Younger within 45 mins with no stress."
"Pliny The Younger","Served in a Brussels glass. "
"Pliny The Younger","After countless attempts to get a glass of this in 2011, my diligence was finally rewarded with a couple glasses of the Younger."
"Pliny The Younger","Wow! I had my first Pliny The Younger yesterday at Abbey Pub in Bend, Oregon. I enjoyed it a great deal. There were about 50 people there when Geoff tapped the keg at Noon. At 12:23pm, the keg was empty. :-) "
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at Falling Rock."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to St. Stephens Green in Phili for my first taste of Younger"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at O'Brien's."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Oskar Blues Longmont"
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at Oskar Blues in Longmont. Phenomenal. Great balance, good mouthfeel, nice hop and pine notes. Had it side by side with an Elder, and definitely taste the difference. That being said, both are delicious. Couldn't even tell it was 11%."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a light orangey amber color with minimal head"
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed on-tap at the Monk's Russian River tasting event on 2/28/11 in Philadelphia, PA. Pre-poured into a wine glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Not sure of the glass size but I had this at Monk's on 2/28. When I got to Monk's the line was pretty long. Looked to be about 100 people so I was shocked to get a glass at all. "
"Pliny The Younger","Finally found this guy this year, i missed out last year. Poured into a 10oz tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","thank you, hulmeville inn, for the great RR tappings on 1 march 2011"
"Pliny The Younger","2/28/11 - 8oz pour in to a tulip glass"
"Pliny The Younger","2011 on tap at Khyber Pass Pub"
"Pliny The Younger","on tap at khyber in philly. served in tulip glass. "
"Pliny The Younger","8oz pour in to a tulip glass. Clear, caramel colored body with a thin head. "
"Pliny The Younger",2/26/2011
"Pliny The Younger","A: A beautiful clear golden color with a nice foamy head that quickly drops to a few off white bubbles on top of the beer. "
"Pliny The Younger","Finally caught up with pliny the elder's nephew"
"Pliny The Younger","At first I was concerned this beer would not live up to the hype. It did."
"Pliny The Younger","Tasted the beer at the bar. I had to wait in line for about one hour and a half. I then just proceeded to drink two 10 oz younger glasses in almost no time at all. It is really exceptional how easy drinking the beer is for its size."
"Pliny The Younger","269th review on BA"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Falling Rock."
"Pliny The Younger","I was luck enough to have this 2 days in a row, 2 10z pours at RR and 2 more the next day at a tapping at Bobby G's in Berkeley. All 4 were equally amazing, though nothing will ever match the first couple sips I had at RR. Rarely does a beer live up to the hype, but this one surpassed it for me."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on-tap at Bobby G's Pizzeria before the rush started, major props to the crew there for managing the craziness with calm and a genial attitude."
"Pliny The Younger","Happened to wander into the Father's Office in Santa Monica, and this was on tap. Score! Had three pours at the bar."
"Pliny The Younger","There is no doubt in my mind. For all the talk and trendy tales about this beer, now I understand this to be one of the greatest IIPA ever crafted."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap tonight at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Enjoyed a relaxing 3 10oz pours with no lines, hassles, or assholes."
"Pliny The Younger","I enjoyed this fine brew on tap at the Blind Lady Ale House in Normal Heights at the 5 o'clock release. Taped out in an hour and I was lucky enough to have 2. One in a 10 oz (.25 L) flute and the other in a 10 oz snifter. The first was paired with .4L of Elder. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Blind Lady Ale House during their Younger vs. Elder event. Poured into a brandy snifter style glass."
"Pliny The Younger","on tap at Toronado SD"
"Pliny The Younger","Not sure how I've forgotten to review this in the past... but no time like the present! "
"Pliny The Younger","2011 Release on release day at RR. This is a transcript of my notes."
"Pliny The Younger","I finally/actually made it up to the brewery to try out this wonderful offering from the people at Russian River. Served in a 10-oz glass. Moderately carbonated."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Toronado SF."
"Pliny The Younger","The annual arrival of what many hopheads consider to be the pinnacle of IPA perfection has become more than a mere release, it's an event. Running dry within the first day of tapping the kegs last year taught the good folks at Russian River a few things. This year they switched things up, releasing a limited amount of kegs per day, and not filling growlers for anyone. As they announced on their website: The only way to get it to go is in your tummy! Works for me."
"Pliny The Younger","First brew rated, figured it should be 'the One'."
"Pliny The Younger","Body is a clear gold poured from draft to about a half-inch head. White foam dissipates pretty quickly to a cap and ring. Leaves trace lacing on the glass, which is motile and does not stick. "
"Pliny The Younger","2011 Pliny the Younger: Pale yellow, medium body and carbonation. Smells like pine and grapefruit. Your taste buds are totally shot after tasting this. Intense earthy hop flavors: marijuana-like and resinous. Probably lots of Columbus hops. Not as citrusy as 2010, but the same de-emphasis of hop bitterness and emphasis on hop flavor. Less bitter than Pliny the Elder. And again, the alcohol is masked by the intense hop flavors. Pretty tasty beer -- hard to explain the hype (especially when you think about all the other delicious double IPAs out there), but one of the best."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at RRBC on Tuesday the 8th and again on Friday the 11th."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Uber last year in Seattle...the keg blew in 12 minutes!"
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap at Toronados"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured at Toronado, San Diego on 2/10/11. $7."
"Pliny The Younger","From tap to wine glass"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Stone 1/10/11"
"Pliny The Younger","This is truly excellent and overall essentially a stronger, slightly more intense and richer version of Pliny the Elder, with the same excellent balance of hop and malt, bitter and sweet, full body and easy drinkability. "
"Pliny The Younger","The things I will do to taste world class beers!!"
"Pliny The Younger","On Tap"
"Pliny The Younger","I manged to get my hands on this one at 11 am at a packed Toronados in San Diego. "
"Pliny The Younger","10 oz draft pour at Russian River Brewery. Almost no head by the time it got to the table, poured a hazy amber or burnt orange. Aroma was very prevalent in the beginning and I got pine, grapefruit, tropical fruit as well as some floral notes. As many others have stated this beer is like a bigger version of Pliny the Elder but somehow it achieves more balance between the malt and the hops. All of that along with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel make this a very drinkable 11% alcohol beer."
"Pliny The Younger","I was one of the first 20 people in the joint SuperBowl Sunday and thought I might as well order a Younger while I'm here. I mean...everyone else was doing it."
"Pliny The Younger","A friend received a growler in a trade last year and shared it with me. I reviewed the beer when we consumed it, but misplaced my notes. I recently discovered them when cleaning out my beergeon."
"Pliny The Younger","Hit the RR brewpub for lunch today. No lines, just a pleasantly packed pub. I loved how the sever immediately said ""What can I get you to drink? Younger?"". I'm sure they knew they would be right 99% of the time."
"Pliny The Younger","Drove up seven hours to Sacramento to stay at Abel's (abecall98) in Sacramento this past Friday, then drove another two hours Saturday morning to go to Santa Rosa...all so I could try this beer again on tap at the SOURCE."
"Pliny The Younger","The most coveted beer on earth - finally after all these years!!!!"
"Pliny The Younger","A long line forms along 4th Street in Santa Rosa every year about this time. The reason? The annual extremely limited release of Pliny the Younger!"
"Pliny The Younger","I was there at the 2011 debut. Simply an outstanding, world-class beer. Floral, pungent hops without the bitterness that so many have unfortunately associated with ""good"" IPA. Well-balanced and obviously carefully crafted, this is a distinctly American beer. And one to be proud of. Well done Russian River. Oh, and watch out because that 10%+ ABV will sneak up on you..."
"Pliny The Younger","Consumed on tap at the brewery on release day 2/4/2011."
"Pliny The Younger","I could smell this baby before I even had a chance to step into the brewpub. Aroma of pine and citrus waft out from the door. The aroma is enticing and I had to smell it for 2 hours while I waited to get in!"
"Pliny The Younger","Went to Russian River's brew pub on the second day of release in 2011. "
"Pliny The Younger","Pliny the Younger is the beer to get on tap. As an IPA drinker I am always skeptical of an IPA that gets a lot of lip and press; however, this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. As a fan of Dreadnaught from Three Floyds, to Sculpin from Ballast Point, the Younger is a truly notable beer. Color is lacking only in the sense that I appreciate a more copper-colored IPA. You cannot beat the smell. It is a scent of heaven, both floral and fruity, and with the taste you get a hint of pine. The hops are indescribably fresh, crisp, and dry. In the event you have the luxury of making it to the Russian River Brewery for this annual beer unveiling, get there early and enjoy the ten ounce pours."
"Pliny The Younger","Growler shared by Grabbin2nd (thanks RJ) on 2/9/10"
"Pliny The Younger","Apearance - Hazy golden copper with a 2 finger white head with medium retention and awesome lacing."
"Pliny The Younger","Somehow this review from notes slipped through the cracks. Had on draft at the Spring House Drafting Room HopFest in April of 2009. Poured into two different 5 oz. tasting glasses (guess they couldn't just do one glass)..."
"Pliny The Younger","A- Pours a light hazed golden orange in color with a soft silky white head. The head retention was okay and it had minimal lacing."
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed this op tap at Flanigan's Boathouse in Summer 2006, just rating it now for some reason. Maybe I'm just sobering up from that strange mid-afternoon event, held on Monday of all days. Fresh bursts of pine cones and grapefruits on the nose, with a lingering sweetness. Orange body, slightly darker than its elder kindred. Just such a wonderful flavor, an explosion of the aforementioned, more candi sugar than the Elder, swirling lighter fruits mingle into an extraordinarily balanced, large, and impressive IIPA. Not the grapefruit peel wonders of Dreadnaught, but an exceptionally balanced utter assault here."
"Pliny The Younger","From (brief) notes:"
"Pliny The Younger","How have I not reviewed this beer? I had it three times this past year on tap, and after recently having Hop Suey on tap, I looked back to my review to see how the scores matched up. Huh. Back to the notes for my review!"
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks, Prufrock, for sharing this rare and delicious treat. Served cool in a taster."
"Pliny The Younger","I have had this several times on tap and once from a growler. This rating is from 2009's growler (notes from the time). Pours with a small white head that fades over a golden body. Even after over a week this still leaves pretty decent lacing. Aroma is sticky gooey pine and citrus hops with earthy and spicy notes as well. Caramel and alcohol also back it up. Hops are straight up Simcoe and Centennial. Very clean, hop first taste with citrus and floral that blends to a sweet caramel and only slightly alcoholic finish. A touch of bitter orange liquor as well. Some pineapple too. This is a great example of hop goodness at its best. Smooth mouthfeel, light bubbles. "
"Pliny The Younger","On-tap at the Bistro double IPA festival (finally, finally putting my notes down into a review)."
"Pliny The Younger","I got this on tap at Pi Bar here in San Francisco."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this at TJ's a few months back. Reviewing from mental notes, pictures, and some very limited notes I typed onto my phone."
"Pliny The Younger","From notes... Went to PtY release on Feb. 5th...Waited in line for 3 hours and was lucky enough to get a couple glasses for my girlfriend and I along with 3 growlers before they sold out an hour after we got there. Appearance was a bit darker and more amber color than Elder. Not a big head with incredible lacing. The smell is mind-blowing...I walked around my house with a an empty growler of it up to my nose during the Super Bowl (that's how amazing it smelled.) It's like the Elder on steroids. The taste is like no other beer in this world. So much pine, floral, sweet caramel, citrus, and hop notes....you can't get more complexity in an IIPA. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy... with SO much drinkability. I can't believe how fast I consumed high quantities of this beer. Can't wait for 2011 release!"
"Pliny The Younger","I was sadden when i heard that Russian River sold out of this beer in the first 8 hours. Frantically I called up every local beer bar in with in an hours drive of Santa Rosa, and found out that Toronado would be tapping a keg in a week at a special Russian River 'tion night. The first sip was very magical and I knew that it was worth the trip. The gobs of hops are not over whelming like you would first expect. I think the bitterness is so intense that your taste receptors just shut down. The 11% alcohol sneaks up on you like drinking a glass or two of really good wine. You get a nice buzz going on, and you do not feel full or bloated from drinking a few pints, since they serve this to you in 8 oz. pours. That was probably one of the greatest nights in my life, until a week later I found out that RRB had a top secret keg of this stuff still available. I noticed a difference in the taste just by the Younger aging only a week, it wasn't as crisp and intense as I had remembered. Although it was still a great beer to drink. That night I had 3 glasses of Younger and a basket of beer bites. I would pay $100 any time to be able to have that night again. It was one of the best meals i have ever had."
"Pliny The Younger","It doesn't take a beer geek to recognize excellence. I had this beer once on tap one upon a springtime in Seattle, on my first visit to the Stumbling Monk. I'd never heard of Pliny at the time but since it was the strongest IPA on tap I requested it. The bartender didn't really play it up, so I was amazed when I got the beer in front of me. The luminous golden cup in front of me bore a heady, floral aroma of citrus and conifer. I remember really tasting the grapefruit in it, and being impressed by both its richness and balance. After a beer this strong I wouldn't usually feel like another one, but this was an exception. I knew at the time that it was easily the best beer I'd ever had, and I haven't found a better one since. The Holy Grail of IPAs."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capones (9oz). Enjoyed with Leafs93 and Damico. Pours an amber orange color, clear, with a thin head. Has an aroma of pine and grapefruit. This was definitely worth the anticipation. Has a great taste, creamy smooth balance of bitter and sweet. Notes of citrus. I think what separates this imperial from other imperials is the creaminess. I love the harsh hop bitters in imperials but the complex flavors here are balanced so well to reduce that harshness. Which is likely what makes it so appetizing to so many beer fans. I will not say it is the best beer I have ever had. But it is near the top of my list."
"Pliny The Younger","2010 version. 8 oz glasses at O'Brien's, 1st keg of the season only a couple weeks after it was released. Waiting in line for about 30 mins, keg was kicked in 10 once they started pouring. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap @ Monk's Cafe during there Russian River event. There was a line outside about 30min before the bar even opened at 11am. By the time the bar opened it was over 60 people long."
"Pliny The Younger","It smelled VERY strongly of hops. My nose is not fancy enough to decipher the different scents - to me, it was just super hoppy. It was light amber/gold, with no real head to speak of. It was sweet and watery when sipped, but had a syrupy feel on my lips afterward. It was nice, sweet, and subtle. Overall, the first half of the glass was really nice. However, after that...it just stopped being all that great. Maybe the hops killed my palate, I don't know. But it's not a beer I would drink a lot of."
"Pliny The Younger","2009 vintage. "
"Pliny The Younger","I got to try this for the first time in my life amidst a mass of beer geeks clambering over the taps at Blue Palms in Hollywood like brokers at the New York Stock Exchange. Luckily I was able to try it again 2 days later at Father's Office in Culver City where it was CONSIDERABLY lower-key, and where I easily got to order 2 glasses (the Blue Plams keg kicked in 7 minutes) and found a seat where I could sit and sip in peace."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado, San Francisco"
"Pliny The Younger","Review from notes taken on 3/20/10 during TJ's: Younger and Elite friends event."
"Pliny The Younger","Source/Serving: Growler fresh from the brewery. It was insanity!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at O'Briens. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had this at the local 44.I felt very fortunate to have the opportunity to try this and even more so to have it in a nice peaceful local with not that many people. I've read some of the reports of PtY madness at other tappings."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Union Jack's Easter Hopfest on 04.03.2010."
"Pliny The Younger","A - served in a tulip glass, clear just the right head, like fabulous"
"Pliny The Younger","(Review from longgg backlog of notes)"
"Pliny The Younger","Growler shared by alexsdad06. Poured clear bright copper color with a large frothy off-white head that was lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy complex sour citrus hop and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with dry slick texture and soft carbonation. Heavy smooth bitter citrus flavor with a heavy bitter finish of long duration with a small alcohol burn as it warms. This is a standout beer. Thanks Brad."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at a few places during SF Beer week but this review is based on the pint at had at Pi Bar during Russian River night."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at TJs in PA for the pouring event. After PtE, Supplication and Consecration (hour or so rest for my palate), how could my day get any better? Served in a snifter at 4PM, I was #14 on the list and showed up 15 minutes before they opened, awesome. The beer is golden-copper with a nice ring and very sticky suds. Light lacing is left and a really cool looking cloud stays in the middle of the beer for the entire experience. Smell is right up there with the best hop aromas for me. I homebrew but still don't understand how to extract hop notes like this. The hops lend citrus, tons of floral and earthy, fruity and pine to a balance of greatness. There is some malt in the background (11% ABV!) and it balances the aroma to perfection. I have rarely had a 10%+ beer with no alcohol in the aroma, impressive. The taste is also one of the best. First off, while sipping on this for probably over an hour, no alcohol ever came into play, ridiculous. The hop profile is once again very earthy and floral and also citrus and fruity. Even some herbal notes come through. A nice malt backbone helps the beer become whole. The malts are like a very good homebrew wort to me and go in nicely with the hops. Mouthfeel was moderate-heavy with great low-medium carbonation that I prefer in huge beers. A really nice warmth hits the tongue along with the perfect amount of bitterness. The creaminess in the feel was very nice. At $6.25 per glass and 11% ABV, this is probably the most dangerous beer I have come across. The drinkability is frightening. I could session this and think it was 5-6% at most, vastly impressive brew."
"Pliny The Younger","On-tap, served in a snifter"
"Pliny The Younger","Big thanks to JZED for sharing and bringing this precious resource back to Ontario from California."
"Pliny The Younger","First beer review, I'd say I'm starting it off right. A thousand thank you's to Hayes for sharing his growler, it was overnighted to him so still very fresh!"
"Pliny The Younger","From a keg almost seven weeks following the release, poured into a snifter glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow color. Not too much in the way of head but what was there was a bit soapy and almost pure white in color. It really clung to the sides of the glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to the Hulmeville inn for this one.Limited to one per person but my wife who is pregant did not want any so WOOHOO!!! Two for me."
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance: light orange in color with a short 1/4"" head that broke down quickly. No lace devlops."
"Pliny The Younger","Blessed with this on tap Saturday at Tria Washington West in Philly. Waited in the rain for a bit, thank god they had a 1-10oz serving/person rule. Keg was kicked about 10-people after we were served."
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap at a ""secret"" tapping, Gray Lodge in NE Philadelphia. Poured into a stemmed pint glass, whatever that may be called! Was fortunate to get the first glass! Pours a bright copper/yellow color. Very small white head that dissapates to a thin ring, pretty quickly too. No real lacing to speak of, but could be due to the ""bar-glass"" washing methods."
"Pliny The Younger","Just got back home from the PtY event at Tria this afternoon, was one of the lucky ones who got in before the keg kicked. Review based on my notes."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours clear with a slight head. Aroma is powerful , fragrant, with strong grapefruit and lily and jasmine. Flavor is huge: hops, grapefuit and lily, with a sugary malt backbone. The mouthfeel is prickly and sharp. The bitterness is slow and sweetish, like a bitter tea. Alcohol is totally hidden, making this a quiet killer."
"Pliny The Younger","Drank this on 2/15, two 17 oz. mugs at Hollingshead's in Orange, CA. From the notes I took at the time:"
"Pliny The Younger","after a year...finally we meet again."
"Pliny The Younger","A: Beautiful in the glass, nice and golden orange with a slight white foam head. The lacing was perfect in my glass as well."
"Pliny The Younger","Ah yes - one of the beer holy grail items. I might as well be a geek and review it."
"Pliny The Younger","Rewriting my review from the ground up. "
"Pliny The Younger","The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding. It's your typical West Coast DIPA, but done to perfection. It has your standard pale malt base which seems to provide adequate balance. The hop aroma is sublime. It's citrusy with hints of pine. It's very bitter, yet not as much as I thought it would be. The taste is great; so smooth and drinkable. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. What there is , is a damn tasty beer that's relatively light and loaded with hops. This is a thing of beauty. The mouthfeel is great as well. It's a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts. There's not heat whatsoever, just heavenly golden nectar."
"Pliny The Younger","Okay... had FOUR glasses while they had it on tap at Henry's. Here goes:"
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to klevelandrocks, marshalzhukov, and craytonic for all sharing growlers with me this year!"
"Pliny The Younger","Received this from sugit."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to my buddy sugit for this sweet growler!!!"
"Pliny The Younger","Tried this rarity for the first time during a special 20-person morning session at Resurrection Ale House. Beer was served with a smile in a medium-sized tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","- Based on 2 10 oz drafts at Resurrection Ale House in Philly:"
"Pliny The Younger","Had a full snifter of this at a tasting at Capones in Norristown, PA. "
"Pliny The Younger","Someone from the East Coast with an opportunity to try and review this highly sought after beer, what an opportunity. I was beginning to compare this beer to the legend of Bigfoot (Sasquatch, not the Barleywine from Sierra), some people have seen it but it's so rare that it's more of a myth than an actual beer. (tongue in cheek, of course)"
"Pliny The Younger","A- nice golden yellow orange. Small skin of head not a bit of lacing. "
"Pliny The Younger","10oz pour at Monk's Cafe, tapped for their Russian River Mad Monday. I got the first retail pour (not to brag), so I'm kind of a big deal. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had 8oz pour on-tap at Falling Rock Taphouse on 2/26/10 as part of their special tapping the night before the Boulder SourFest. Place was packed so glad that ummagum and I got there 1.5 hrs early and got a table. It was a slightly hazy golden orange color. Had slight carb streams. Couldn't tell how soon after pouring that we got it since it was a mass delivery but it still had a 1/8"" foam cap that stayed there for the duration (especially as I kept swirling it to kick up the awesome aromas). My glass had good lacing and not much sticking but my friend's had great lacing and lots of sticking so I used his as the lacing reference and chalked mine up to washing issues. "
"Pliny The Younger","On Tap @ Monk's Cafe"
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks treyrab for the growler hookup connection... living in Alaska, this is a dream come true for me, the anticipation was...well, you know what it was. to the beer:"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured into a 10oz tulip. Very slight creamy head with light sense of cabonation. Color a clear golden with slight amber hue (though to be fair the lighting was pretty bad). "
"Pliny The Younger","Pours an almost crystal clear golden orange color. Huge frothy white head that lingers, leaves great lacing and holds the delicious smell. The scent is a beautiful whiff of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple with vauge hints of pale malt and pine resin. I found myself smelling this beer more than i was sipping. Taste begins with the semi-acidic grapefruit, mellowing into a semi-sweet pineapple and tangerine. Bitterness comes through in the end through tastes of pine resin. In between, definite tastes of pale malt are present and provide just enough to smooth the edges between flavors. Body is medium, slightly oily and slick, but does not linger on the palate and cloud future sips. Overall, and excellent dIPA... more akin to a hoppier version of Blind Pig due to all the fruit notes. To me it appeared much less bitter than the PtE due to these tropical fruits."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Monk's amidst the chaos. Here we go!"
"Pliny The Younger","10 oz. pour on-tap at The Horse Brass. Just fantastic blending of malty backbone with an up-front hoppy citrusy bitterness. Not nearly as unbalanced as I expected, but just as good. Really a superbly-balanced beer considering how strong it is. A much more pleasant and drinkable beer than I expected, and not the up-front flavor overload I was bracing myself for. I could drink a lot of these back-to-back."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a growler into a tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","At long last. Enjoyed a half pint on tap at Falling Rock. It was worth the wait. Pours a beautiful golden color with a nice, frothy head. It almost smelled better than it tasted, extremely fragrant floral, piney aroma."
"Pliny The Younger","Growler shared by AJ. Thanks AJ! Pours clear orange color with thick off white head. Aroma is citrus, simcoe hops with grapefruit rind, and some resinous stinky citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is an explosion of flavor. It follows the nose nicely and I can detect layers of resinous hop goodness. Upfront its citrus, then comes simcoe citrus, followed by pine sol flavor, and coats my mouth with hop resins and finishes with a touch of heat. Overall the alcohol is hidden well and I do detect a touch of alcohol in the finish. With more hops. Wonderful beer. Thanks AJ!"
"Pliny The Younger","Sampling this live right now at Capone's."
"Pliny The Younger","holy crap i never thought i would ever get to try this but after a six hour drive and a 2 hour wait at the bar and here i am "
"Pliny The Younger","First, second, third, etc. many solar system-sized thanks to cloudskipper for going through the trouble of securing this growler & shipping it to the cold northern steppes. Was going to get one last year but turned out I was going on vacation after the release, so I've been waiting an entire year for this opportunity. Break out the glasses & pour that Younger!"
"Pliny The Younger","2010 growler. Yet another huge thanks to DuffManSW for hooking this up! Big, loose white head with great lacing and a nice golden color. Big juicy melon and citrus notes in the aroma with hints of honey, honeydew melon, and a distinct skunky homegrown (yeah that kind) quality. The flavor is a juicy blend of wet hops, melon, grapefruit, tropical fruit, and a mellow bitterness on the finish that just lingers forever. The body is creamy and medium-full with soft carbonation."
"Pliny The Younger","I'm proud to say that this beer will be my first review. "
"Pliny The Younger","In my opinion, the Younger is a stronger, hoppier (both are ridiculous) Elder. Nose is slightly more tropical and grapefruity than Elder. There is also a little more candi-cookie sweetness than the Elder. With a slightly lighter feeling body, deceptively, yet equally smooth and dry and refreshing. So fresh and delicious, a true ode to the hops."
"Pliny The Younger","Growler shared by jerz at Woodshop 5.0. Pours a clear gold with an orange tinge and a creamy dense white head. Aroma is hugely pineappley/grapefruity with vanilla and a piney herbal character. Flavor is very herbal and bitter, lots of resins for sure. Sweetness comes through only in an orange/lychee hoppiness. Malt? What malt? We don't need no stinkin malt. Even if there was a pound of peated malt in this I wouldn't be able to taste it through the absurd hop whirlwind. I think I used the word ""whirlwind"" in my PTE review too now that I think about it. Whatever, this beer pulverizes. I'll rerate next year off a proper pint."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Abbey Pub in Bend...Personal thanks to Geoff for bring this on!"
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled at a local tasting in St. Louis, big thanks to hooliganlife for bring 2 growlers."
"Pliny The Younger","A secret tapping at Teresas Next Door on 2/23/10.Thanks Matt and Andy for the heads up."
"Pliny The Younger","Well, here it is, I finally get to try more than a tiny serving of this much-coveted beer. Poured into a tulip. I'm actually a little nervous because I know the reviews for this beer are scrutinized. While it does pour an attractive semi-clouded gold, the foam recedes rather quickly, leaving a few large bubbles on the surface. "
"Pliny The Younger","Received a growler of this from the super generous abecall98. I've missed this damn beer the past three years and I decided the 2010 version needed to be in my belly. Drank from some sort of Belgium snifter thingy with Mr. Scoobydank."
"Pliny The Younger","02.05.10 at Toronado"
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed a tulip of this on draft at Teresas's this afternoon. It was a quiet tapping, nothing advertised or broadcasted about it. Which I personally enjoyed much more so than the mayhem of other releases. Anyways, this was my first time having it."
"Pliny The Younger","So friends of mine asked me what good beer I had around and I popped open a growler of younger. After half a glass, the double digit ABV frightened them off, and I was left with half a growler. I can't complain because this is a beautiful beer. It Poured a nice amber color, almost like mead, With a good solid head and an all hop aroma. The taste was exquisite with a heavy hop forward bitter blast, balanced out by a honey/nectar malt flavor. I had 3 glasses and I could drink this alll night if it were not for the alcohol hitting me after glass 3. It's an amazing beer!"
"Pliny The Younger","I got in line more than an hour early for EBF session one to ensure I got a taste of this behemoth. That turned out to be unnecessary when it lasted more than two hours into the session. I even ended up getting a second sample."
"Pliny The Younger","2010 on tap at the Horse Brass Pub and Saraveza in Portland, OR"
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to my Cali connection Nick for going through a lot of trouble to pick up and send a growler of this fine nectar my way."
"Pliny The Younger","I am not the biggest fan of big, strong IPA's. They are by no means my favorite style. I do however respect them, enjoy them, and admire their sometimes complex layers of flavor. "
"Pliny The Younger","Cheers to Mikeoxlong for trading this growler, I have been wanting to try this beer for about 2 years now! Als shared among friends as it will be ahrd to finish a whole growler!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the EBF 2010."
"Pliny The Younger","Gave this one the once over at Barley and Hops in Temecula, CA. I feel priveleged to review the number one beer in the world right now."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got a chance to try the newest number one on Beeradvocate.com."
"Pliny The Younger","Had a few glasses with my homey Joe. Poured from a super cool flip-top growler, it has a bright, yellow gold color with good clarity. The head is white with good retention and lacing. Carbonation held up good in the growler shipped across the country."
"Pliny The Younger","I had several ounces of Pliny the Younger poured by Vinnie himself at the Extreme Beerfest."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to a very generous BA for dealing with the madness at the release and shipping through one of the worst storms DC has ever seen to get this to me. It's been a long weekend of driving up and back to Buffalo and I've been looking forward to opening this growler."
"Pliny The Younger","Walked into one of favorite bars and there it was. I was very happy. "
"Pliny The Younger","Infinitely huge thanks to generous Evan (beddachedda) for sending me a growler and being almost too fair in the trade when everyone else was getting shut out! You rock! Poured from the standard 2L Russian River sweet looking swingtop at Dave's place with a bunch of Chicago beer crew."
"Pliny The Younger","Big thanks to errantnight for hooking me up with this long time want."
"Pliny The Younger","Was lucky enough to be at Pizza Port San Clemente on Valentines night and got talking to the bartender. Great beer there as always. Well, the bartender told me they had two five gallon kegs waiting to go on tap. He didn't tell me it would be on at opening, but he also didn't think they would put it on later in the day."
"Pliny The Younger","HUGE thanks to dukedevil0 for sharing this with the Chicago BA crew. Just an amazing display of awesomeness by Dave!"
"Pliny The Younger","Hand bottle from LongBeachHopHead. I decided if I tasted any sort of trouble with the bottle I wouldn't review it. It landed on my doorstep today and I'm cracking it with friends to share the love."
"Pliny The Younger","Had it on Tap three times now, tasting notes are from 2/9/10. Just had a glass about an hour ago and feel the notes I took are still accurate so here we go!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver on Tuesday and was very lucky to have gotten the two glasses of it that I did as the first keg was gone after about 10 minutes, and the second very shortly thereafter. "
"Pliny The Younger","A huge thanks to Matt (drabmuh) for sharing his growler with me!"
"Pliny The Younger","A huge thanks to treyrab for sharing some of his growler with me! Couldn't wait to dig into this one after all I had heard about it and was eager to see what this beer was all about. Poured into my tulip glass..."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Malt and Vine in Redmond."
"Pliny The Younger","This beer is definitely the pinnacle of IPA's. The IPA has a beautiful caramel color, similar to an old German Riesling and a wonderful hop aroma that makes you feel as if you're running through a field of hop vines. The taste embodies the classic characteristics of a West Coast IPA with strong presence of bittering hops resembling Chinook. The mouthfeel is amazing, very smooth and fully bodied with less carbonation than a typical West Coast which improves its drinkability. You can easily suck back several pints of the Younger without worrying that your taste buds will be recked. Overall, an amazing IPA worth the status of number one Beer on the Planet"
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to jrallen34 who let me share his growler with him."
"Pliny The Younger","REVIEW 500!"
"Pliny The Younger","Huge thanks to Dave for sharing this, never thought i'd try it. "
"Pliny The Younger","Growler shared by Dave (dukedevil0), thank you sir! Poured into a tasting glass a couple of times."
"Pliny The Younger","growler into balloon glass."
"Pliny The Younger","I drank this from RR growler into my Rochefort chalice."
"Pliny The Younger","A- A gloriously bright, clear golden beer. Sexy fluffy yet creamy head, lacing to die for. Really is beautiful in the tulip glass here at Pi Bar."
"Pliny The Younger","Growler shared by mreusch. Thanks! Served in a Boulevard Tank 7 glass. Poured a deep gold with a thin white head. Massive piney hop aroma. Flavor is dominated by hop bitterness as you would expect, but there is a solid malt base without being sweet. Very drinkable for the abv, alcohol was not very evident. Lots of hops without being too green in the flavor. Nice mouthfeel, medium to full bodied. Believe the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","A very generous growler gift from my pal, Arbitrator! Thanks a million, my friend..."
"Pliny The Younger","Lucky enough to have this on tap on a visit to Russian River. "
"Pliny The Younger","Growler from my sister who has relocated to Napa who happened upon the event per my begging. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Father's Office. I had three of these nice little guys before the bar was even half full. I greatly appreciate the bar abstaining from doing a hyped-up Pliny the Younger night. Much nicer in my opinion to bust this thing out quietly. "
"Pliny The Younger","Tasted this tonight at a local tasting. My buddy Keith got this through a trade and he is awesome enough to share with us. Pours a really clear yellow to light orange with some Hop residue in my glass, yep hops I say. I am not a great smeller, but I do smell a ton of hops. So, for a normal person, you would smell a mega ton, I bet. The taste is very floral and not over bittering, which is great in my book. I am not a bitter freak, I like hop flavors. Wish we could get this in Florida year round."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Pizza Port San Clemente"
"Pliny The Younger","Review #200."
"Pliny The Younger","I've waited about 4 years to get a chance to try this beer, and am very glad to be able to do so just a few days after it took the top spot."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to concourse for the share on this one. Very interested to see if it lives up to the hype."
"Pliny The Younger","On-tap at Tustin Brewery (8oz pour)"
"Pliny The Younger","Making a 125 mile trip worthwhile. Feb 13, 2010 was the start of a brew tour beginning at Port Brewing to grab some Red Poppy Ale and Angels Share Grand Cru."
"Pliny The Younger","Draft serving in a 0.5 L mug at Hollingshead."
"Pliny The Younger","I want to do a standard review, but this deserves so much more. I'll start with appearance. This beer poured a burnt orange color that was lightly effervescent, but had great lacing and head retention. Smell was slightly piney, but more florally and citrusy. This is bitter. And not a harsh and spicey bitter, but a citrusy and floraly bitter. The younger gives it smell every cent it's worth. Hints of diacetyl on the malt. This is very well balanced. More on the hoppy side, but the malt gives the perfect smootheness to it that makes it so drinkable. Hops sit on the palate and fills the nose with that perfumy floral hops. I had a 17 oz pour and I've become a philosopher. Amazing beer. Never had better."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to LongBeachHopHead for hand bottling this beauty so that I could taste the hype, and this is a case where I can believe the hype. "
"Pliny The Younger","A huge thanks to tzanio for this one!"
"Pliny The Younger","REVIEW # 400 (FOR ME)"
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks a million to alcstradamus for his generosity."
"Pliny The Younger","Quite clear with a smallish head that dissipates quickly leaving a little bit of foam around the edge of the glass. This beer smells fabulous. To quote a friend ""if hops had a vagina this is what it would smell like"" The fresh, grassy, grapefruity, cleanliness of this aroma is what I want to reek of when I get out of the shower. (even though I would probably find myself only able to attract middle-aged fat and/or balding men with beards). The flavor follows the smell, though it is not as complex or nearly so orgasmic. Super-dry and bracingly bitter, I would even say that the bitterness is a bit over the top, but only a bit. The mouthfeel is unremarkable, acceptable levels of carbonation... not tannic or anything."
"Pliny The Younger","Much thanks to Sugit for providing this growler. This was definitely an experience, and we drank it on the very day (2/13/10) it takes the BA #1 spot. There isn't much that hasn't already been said, but here are my thoughts."
"Pliny The Younger","Many, many thanks to Wespatrick for sharing this gem. Had at a tasting last night, Feb 13th. Reviewed from notes."
"Pliny The Younger","After tap, now on to the growler courtesy of Grabbin2nd."
"Pliny The Younger","TaNgerine hued copper, slight haze--yeast or dry hopping?"
"Pliny The Younger","Many Thanks to a very generous trader for hooking me up with this one. I can't thank you enough (!), especially with all the craziness surrounding the release. I split this side by side with Elder (bottled 1/14) with my homie Jeff the other night. "
"Pliny The Younger","HUGE thanks to Chad, a fellow Hoosier that's been transplanted to California. 64oz swing-top growler from the brewery. Served in an oversized tulip and shared with fellow BA infestaxion."
"Pliny The Younger","Growler from augustgarage. Many thanks!"
"Pliny The Younger","Growler received from jfh. Thanks a ton for this one! Poured into a Bruery tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","APPEARANCE "
"Pliny The Younger","I was totally stoked to get a growler of this in the mail yesterday. Many many many thanks again go out to mjl21...Mike you made my year with this beer!"
"Pliny The Younger","I can honestly say this is a beer that I never thought I'd have the opportunity to drink, but I'm extremely grateful to chris for hooking me up with a growler from the most recent release. I am especially thankful because it sounds like it sold out in about 5 hours this year."
"Pliny The Younger","Nice clear golden pour with two fingers of sticky head. The smell is an absolutely blistering assault on the senses. Sinus cleansing levels of hops. Huge floral and pine notes with an underlying orange peel citrus aroma. This takes the bar set by other west coast IPAs and throws it like a javelin through the heart of restraint."
"Pliny The Younger","Has it really been a year since I sipped this delicious nectar? Yes. Yes it has. "
"Pliny The Younger","A huge thanks goes out to my buddy Ryan for hooking me up with this. After two years gone by of PtY trades falling through, Ryan stepped up big, not to mention the best packaging job I've ever seen on a growler."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a growler into my Duvel tulip thanks to Evan, thanks again brah! I owe you big time!"
"Pliny The Younger","Received my growler today from moosington-thanks man, this sure was a great trade. It is being shared with two BA's. I start the evening of excitement with the unveiling of the growler."
"Pliny The Younger","MAMMOTH thanks to JMoore for this."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a deep amber gold with a thin bubbly off white head. Retention is average, nothing special."
"Pliny The Younger","As a huge fan of The Elder, I waited patiently to find the Younger and was frustrated by near misses and the grim prospect of never actually tasting this beer. Sheer serendipity brought it to my lips; the tapping was unannounced and no sign was displayed. ""We're just trying to keep it mellow, so don't make a big deal about it,"" the bartender advised."
"Pliny The Younger","HUGE Thanks to Jerz for hooking me and my crew up! We don't get a lot of good beer up in Fargo, so this is a treat!"
"Pliny The Younger","Paid $6.25 for a 12oz pour into a pint glass at the Englander in San Leandro, CA."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado SD, into a tulip:"
"Pliny The Younger","Received a growler as part of a trade with Ricand. He sent it overnight from California to Indiana so that I could have it as fresh as possible. Gathered with four friends they day it arrived. I've been waiting to try this beer for a LONG time, and was very excited to finally give it a shot. Thanks again, Rick!"
"Pliny The Younger","I've been lucky enough to have a good share of this beer over the last week at both the release day and at the DIPA fest and enjoyed it immensely but the social nature of said events didn't permit me to take notes. I'm reviewing tonight from my only growler. From notes 02/10/10."
"Pliny The Younger","on tap"
"Pliny The Younger","Big ups to eliottJW and juhl31 for scoring me a growler, even when I couldn't make it up to the brewpub. A true friend indeed. Shared with many other friends and poured into a New Belgium tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","Got this in a trade with barleywinefiend. You da man Josh!"
"Pliny The Younger","A huge thanks to Jerz and VacaX for making the trek from Long Beach to Russian River, and fighting through the mob to bring this back to So Cal. They're champs for their efforts, and I don't know how I'll begin to repay them."
"Pliny The Younger","By the time we got to the bar to ask for growlers. They told us it was gonna be a while but here's a couple glasses to enjoy while you wait."
"Pliny The Younger","My 300th review"
"Pliny The Younger","I acquired a growler of the infamous Younger from vacax (thanks mate)! Served it in a Bruery tulip glass. I poured 3 glasses of RR brews and compared them. Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger."
"Pliny The Younger","Multiple draught and growler samples over the past weekend. First sip last friday at the release day which was supposed to be the start of a release week, though things didn't exactly work out that way. Walking into the Russian River brewpub, the aroma hits you at once. Yes, you heard correctly; I just rated the aroma by entering the room. Elder is probably my favorite DIPA, so a side-by-side was necessary to really get a feel for its larger nephew. The color is a deep gold, going a touch darker than Elder. The head is small, with some sticky white foam lingering in a slick. Oddly enough, at first, Elder has a much more expressive aroma, leaning on more pine and pungent dankness. I do a double take on Younger: there is a touch of alcohol and orange showing but it seems pretty closed. Temperature is definitely key with this beer. Many larger DIPAs (or TIPAs in this case) seem to benefit from a cooler serving temperature that lets the hops keep the upper hand over the malt sweetness. Younger breaks that mold because it is about as dry as you can get and still maintain balance in a beer this big. I have heard that it has been sweeter in past years, but can't say firsthand how this years release compares. All that I can say is that the sweetness never becomes at all bothersome. Sure, it is evident when compared right next to Elder, which elegantly shows how dry the style can be, but it works perfectly with the massive hop load. Let the temperature come up a few degrees, and the hops become incredibly juicy and expressive, showing all kinds of orange, mango, and grapefruit. There is a similar resiny dank touch as you get in elder, but it is overall rounder, fruitier, and juicier, probably helped in part be the additional perception of sweetness. The flavor is just crazy hoppy without being at all abrasive. This is one amazingly smooth beer, with just a hint of alcohol in the finish to remind you that it is nearly eleven percent full of it. Bitterness is almost mild to start, only building to full strength toward the back of the tongue. Mildly malty and sweet, but it's pretty damn had to pick out much definable malt character over all the hops. Medium-full body with smooth carbonation. Just about the perfect consistency for a beer like this, with the hop oils contributing as much mouthfeel as anything else. Younger has a surprising amount of subtlety and balance for a beer this big and hoppy. It definitely has more nuance than most big DIPAs, and may even be a touch understated. In the end, it works perfectly just like Elder works perfectly, just from a different approach."
"Pliny The Younger",Amazing.
"Pliny The Younger","A-Beautiful color, golden light amber, clear"
"Pliny The Younger","I'm scoring this from when I had it on tap at the 2010 friday release at Russian River. I am going to pick out the aroma/flavors from a growler pour at home during this review, but I wanted to give it the on-tap score because the mouthfeel is better on-tap."
"Pliny The Younger","Long time BA, but a first time reviewer. I think I've chosen a fairly worthy beer for my first review."
"Pliny The Younger","Sharing my buddies growler during the big game."
"Pliny The Younger","Believe the hype... that's all that really needs to be said about this beer. perfection. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had it on tap at the brewpub on release day...in a word unbelievable. One sip and my perspective of IPA's was changed forever. Completely destroyed my taste buds. Sticky and chewy in the mouth. Today (2 days after release) I just opened a growler and it is just as awesome. It is IPA perfection. Floral hop scent, good head, a little cloudy. The hops resonate in my mouth and the bitterness removes all saliva. If you are a hophead this is the pinnacle of beer."
"Pliny The Younger","On-tap at the brewpub on release day, less than 20 minutes after opening. Poured into a generic 10oz nonic. Consumed on a sunny day out on the patio."
"Pliny The Younger","I truly believe that not enough good things can be said about this beer. I had it on-tap at the release day. I also split a growler of it with friends the day after the release. Very fortunate to write this review. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on-tap yesterday and am having it from a growler now. If this beer were available year-round, I'd drink nothing but. "
"Pliny The Younger","After standing in line for that long, just about anything would taste good. So I had several glasses to make sure my judgement was clear."
"Pliny The Younger","Kinda bummed only got one growler. Waited in line from 1-3. They ran out of growlers while I was in the bar. Our waiter was kind enough to search out one growler for us. There was even some jerk who bought over 20 growlers."
"Pliny The Younger","I got 4 growlers of this today at Russian River Brewery."
"Pliny The Younger","Sitting in the taproom sipping a younger."
"Pliny The Younger","I've had this elixir twice --- once during its regular Feb. '09 release at the Eastside Tavern in Olympia and once, surprisingly, at HopFest at Brouwer's this past summer."
"Pliny The Younger","Review transcribed from a RB review from Feb. '09. I have actually only had this beer once, and I was fairly drunk at the time. Mark my words, I will practically live at Russian River Brewing when this is released in '10. So did it live up to the hype? In a word, yes. This is a sweet hoppy nectar of the gods. It really just doesn't get much better than this. Had it on tap at Toronado in SF."
"Pliny The Younger","Okay,so this is one of those great hype beers, the father of all IIPAs, etc., etc."
"Pliny The Younger","othing. Seriously, this was a nice treat. Pours gold with a thin white head. Juicy hop and citrus aroma. Flavor was very fresh with the with sticky pine and floral hops dominating and citrus fruits coming up in a close second. Slightly sweeter than expected, but it still has a nice dry bitter finish. This was very nice."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this at lucky baldwins in pasadena, ca. They had an IPA fest going alll week with rumors of a PTY keg that they would crack sometime during the week, so i went a couple times out of the week then last minute i went again and BEHOLD! it was finally on tap! i grabbed two glasses of it and enjoyed the SHIT out of them."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this at the Local 44 in West Philly during Philly Beer Week. Awesome lineup of RR brews on tap! Review from notes (3/15/09)."
"Pliny The Younger","I had to fly all the way across the country to try this beer and just stumbled into a bar that happened to have it on tap. Lucky me."
"Pliny The Younger","Oh YEA!! This was all it was purported to be. Had it on tap at Russian River last week. Poured (in a 10 oz. glass) to a bright orange-red color with good head and lacing. Strong nose of hoppy citrusy grapefruit hit me as the waitress approached. As I nursed it along, the 11% abv also became much more noticeable. Mouthfeel was very full and slightly tingly, and the taste was a very dominant bitter grapefruit blended perfectly with alcohol and a touch of malt to round things out. I sipped toward the finish, which was long, very smooth and warming."
"Pliny The Younger","A: Poured into a snifter at the Bottleworks Grand Re-Opening. They had a great selection but my mind was already set before I walked in. Golden orange with burnt lemon and butterscotch hues. Infusion of well balanced hazy copper rich tones. While lighter in complexion than my expectations it is a fantastic looking beer. Perfect pearl white head that fluffed up like thousands of minuscule marshmallows. Retention was strong. Sticky crystallized lacing all down the glass. "
"Pliny The Younger","2012 batch..."
"Pliny The Younger","Viggo was nice enough to share this one. huge thanks eric!"
"Pliny The Younger","HUGE thanks to nerd for hooking me up with this growler IP at DLD, I owe you man, been waiting a long time for this one. "
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks very much to Grant for sharing this growler at the Brick Store Pub. I've somehow missed this every year in California even though I'm usually there every time it comes out- sadly I'm usually working too hard then to seek it out or go up to Santa Rosa. I love the Elder, and this beer is every bit as good as I'd hoped. Pours golden with okay head and some excellent lacing. Very nice for a growler. A beautiful blast of pine on the nose with some lovely sweet caramel malt providing a nicely layered backbone underneath. For me, the taste is perfect. Sweet malt and a heavy dose of extremely fresh tasting piney hops that have just oozed their oils into this brew. Some nice citrus on the finish as well that combines with the sweet malt for a nice slightly candied finish to the herbal explosion that came beforehand. Deep flavors that roll on and on. Exquisite. The mouthfeel is at first prickly with hops and then smooth with creamy malt. Looong finish. Utterly delicious. I could drink this all day and pay for it later. Not as dry as the Elder of course, but even more deeply flavored. A masterpiece from my favorite brewery."
"Pliny The Younger","I was finally able to try the mighty Pliny the Younger on tap during the Drafting Room's Hop Fest V. I originally thought they were going to tap Pliny the Elder, but they tapped Pliny the Younger instead. What a pleasant surprise!"
"Pliny The Younger","Served on-tap at TJs a few weeks back, from my notes. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach."
"Pliny The Younger","A: Color is rich, pale hued but with an orange and honey goodness. Not a lot of head or lacing, but the carbonation appears bubbles up in champagne-reminscent strands."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Union Jack's in Boyertown, Pa as part of Easter Hopfest '09. Served in a tulip; 10.5 oz. serving."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap @ Union Jack's (Boyertown, PA) on 4/11/09. Part of the '09 Easter Hopfest. "
"Pliny The Younger","Two 10oz tulip glasses on tap Saturday 4/11/09 @ Union Jack's - from cell phone notes:"
"Pliny The Younger","Had this on tap at Falling Rock and damn was it good. It had a tremendous aroma of grapefruit and hops. On the palate, it was big and malty, then a wave of intense hop flavor the likes of which I have never experienced before. The pure essence of hop flavor. Bitterness came slowly, but eventually saturated the back of my mouth and did not leave. A looonnnnggg finish."
"Pliny The Younger","Served in a snifter at Capone's on Sunday morning March 29th, 2009. What a fantastic event. Kudos, as usual to Matt and his peeps. Double IPAs and strong sour beers at 10am on a Sunday, BooYa Grandma!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Tria Washington Square - I drove 30 miles to partake. Tria was exceeding fire code capacity when we arrived at 6:45, so I had to take the wife to Banana Republic to spend some cash and kill some time. Luckily the kegs were still dispensing when we returned at 7:30."
"Pliny The Younger","finally i had the holy grail! On tap at Tria for their thurs barrel tasting series. Poured into a crystal wine glass, great glass lacing and clarity, wonderful color. And the smeill, as I would expect from a RR beer and having had the elder, great piney floral hops hops and more hops..."
"Pliny The Younger","A - pours a clear slightly orangish yellow with a nice fluffy white foam that left plenty of sticky lacing"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Devil's Den in Philadelphia. My first visit there and certainly not my last."
"Pliny The Younger","A - Classic IPA coloration of amberish golden"
"Pliny The Younger","I am not into overhyped beers, but PtY really is as strong as the reviews indicate. Straight 5's fromm me. "
"Pliny The Younger","Got to try this on tap at Capone's. Pours orange with a thick white head. Aroma of nice hop oils and crackery malt. Flavor is quite malty with a sweet finish. A bit heavy and harsh at times and not as citrusy as the growler version I had. Certainly not as citrusy as Elder. Second time around I was less impressed by this one. It is a heavy IIPA and at times overbearing. Fun to try, but I think I'm done seeking out this one. Elder is better!"
"Pliny The Younger","Russian River- Pliny the Younger"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capone's on 3/29/09. Served in a snifter."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capone's..."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at TJs Everyday. Saved my notes so this could be review #400."
"Pliny The Younger","so, after a couple of years of wanting to try this I get a growler courtesy of a gracious CA BA. Intense yet not brackish bitter piney resinous hop heaven! Smooth, so easy to drink. Wow. This one lives up to the hype. I don't know how they pack all that hop into one beer but it's well worth it. Funny note from day 2 on the growler. I popped the top and was greeted by the most insane rush of pine. It was mind boggling."
"Pliny The Younger","When I was lucky enough to get some of this beer it was a day old open growler. I liked the beer but I bet it would be better freshly opened."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this after the Firkin Fest at the Green Dragon. I would have rather had this early in the night but it wasn't an option. After drinking warm cask conditioned beers all day this was as an exceptional way to end the event. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap at the South Philly Tap Room. Served in a wine glass."
"Pliny The Younger","3/20 @ Russian River. 10 Oz. glass. Pours clear caramel with a head that quickly turns into lacing. HUGE aroma of grapefruit, pine, caramel and sweet malts. Equally huge taste. Finish is extremely well balanced. Hard to believe it's 11%. Incredibly drinkable. Very gracious to try this tasty treat!"
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a golden orange into a Chimay-ette glass. Yes, that be a mini Chimay, a glass reserved for the heathens and the wannabees for such holier than thou brews! The rest of us, with permission, drink from a standard Chimay glass. Alas, we all fail. As this beer, and so many others are better consumed from a wine glass in my opinion, but alas, I digress. Brew looks good on the pour yet an off white head dissipates swiftly, leaving little lacing."
"Pliny The Younger","Just had this on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Union Jacks in Glenside. Served in a 10oz serving."
"Pliny The Younger","On Tap at the Local 44 event."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Local 44. Great event."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Local 44 and the Memphis Taproom yesterday"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Local 44 and Memphis Taproom in Philly yesterday."
"Pliny The Younger","Was able to do a nice vertical of the Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger."
"Pliny The Younger","$7.70 for a full Chimay chalice worth of Pliny the Younger at Local 44 for their Russian River Philadelphia Beer Week Event."
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed this one several times throughout the week of it hitting seattle. First was at collins pub"
"Pliny The Younger","Had on-tap at Belmont Station in Portland, OR (they had it on tap for only one day during their IPA week)"
"Pliny The Younger","Served at Obriens $5 for a 10 oz. tumbler."
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed on-tap at Uber Tavern in Seattle, WA as my first beer of the night (clean palate!)"
"Pliny The Younger","Served cold, in a pint glass, on tap at Catalyst in Fort Collins, Colorado."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at O'Brien's, once again. Served in 10oz. glasses, a brilliant yellow gold with pristene clarity and a pure white 1/4"" foam head."
"Pliny The Younger","3/6/09 10 oz pour at O'Briens (x2)."
"Pliny The Younger","10oz glass poured on draft at Bailey's Taproom. Color somewhere between golden and amber, without much in the way of a head. Aroma of sharp, floral, piny hops, with notes of pineapple and cannabis. Palate is a straight-up hop bomb, possibly the hoppiest beer I've had outside of fresh hop season here in Oregon. Grass, pineapple, and cannabis notes peek through the sticky, syrupy, hoppy backbone, while a touch of bready malt comes through to balance things out on the finish, only to be overtaken by a serious grapefruit character that lingers long after the swallow. A fantastic offering, although somewhat brutal on the palate. But, if you love hops like I do, you've got to try it."
"Pliny The Younger","For sure one of the best IPA's in the world. Pours an orangish brown with a silky beige head. "
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance- Orange Amber liquid with a fluffy off white head"
"Pliny The Younger","Tons of cheers to Beerzebub for this one. "
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance: That same hazy golden-orange color of the Elder with the same cloud-white head. the head sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Had on tap at Fathers Office in Santa Monica, CA. A nice suprise on a recent trip there. Pours copper, looks virtually clear, with creamy head and decent lacing and retention (note: bar lighting was not the best so this is the best I can get to the look). Smell was superb. A nice kick of piney hops with some caramel maltiness. There is a presence of alcohol but nothing terrible. Taste was great as well. A strong citric kick to it, stong tastes of pineapple and grapefruit I thought. Strong malt backbone, a bit of a sweet caramel taste. Warming on the way down and leaves behind a nice hop bitterness to it. The first sip is pretty intense I must say. The mouthfeel was perfect I thought. Very smooth, somewhat silky...just great. Not too light or thin, but not too thick or creamy. Overall a great beer, not that anyone is suprised. I could easily have a couple in a sitting. I, unfortunately, had to drive so I could just enjoy the one. But between a great beer and a great bar, this was an amazing beer experience."
"Pliny The Younger","I have long since given up on milestone beers. That being said this beer is a milestone all on its own so I am going to make it review 900. It has been my holy grail for the past year or so and a great big fucking thanks goes out to Talisker for once again hooking a brother up!"
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled at the 9th Annual Double IPA Festival at the Bistro in Hayward."
"Pliny The Younger","I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass pub in Portland."
"Pliny The Younger","I finally got the chance to try Pliney the Younger at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver and it was well worth the wait."
"Pliny The Younger","Falling rock had this on tap, and I didn't want to miss it. served in small snifter at the half pint volume. "
"Pliny The Younger","Had this courtesy of gford217 - thanks!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Falling Rock $7 per 1/2 pint, wow. Served in a wine glass, nice orange color, smells amazingly hoppy like Pliny the Elder. Tastes bitter, hoppy, stronger. Honestly I think the Elder is better. This didn't seem to add hoppy value, only alcohol. A delicious IPA but the elder is better as far as I'm concerned."
"Pliny The Younger","Evan, who works at Brewbakers in Huntington and is a regular at Beachwood, popped in and was nice enough to trade me some of the Abyss '07 I had just bought for a few pours from one of his RR Growlers of the newest PtY batch. Many thanks to him for allowing me to finally try Younger - it was worth it."
"Pliny The Younger","Memorable Quality: The smell is an out of this world basket of hops, the hops punched me in the face like I have never experienced from a beer before. I felt like I was chewing a hop plant. I thought about this beer for days after I drank it, thoroughly deserving of the hype, the best hoppy beer on the planet."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours from growler golden honey, substantial head dissapates to in impressive thin bubbly swirling lace that refuses to fade. Not expecting this with a brew of such girth. Rings of lace cling to the snifter. Pungent citrus hop aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and sticky sappy pine needles. It's hard to keep your nose out of the glass on this one. Taste is again a rush of citrus hops with a nice piney bitterness. Some very lite honey like malts sneak in mid way. Mouth is smooth but somewhat sticky. Finishes with a slight boozy warmth that coats the mouth with some apricot and again piney bitterness. The 11%abv was extremely well hidden and way to easy to drink. This was simply fantastic. Thanks so much Chris, for the unbelevable opportunity to try this from the source."
"Pliny The Younger","It was on tap at Collin's Pub Seattle"
"Pliny The Younger","Found the Younger on tap - not once, but twice - today in Portland. 10 oz. pour at Concordia Ale House (tapered glass - $8), 10 oz. pour at Henry's Tavern (snifter - $6.25)."
"Pliny The Younger","Update 2/24/2010-"
"Pliny The Younger","A- This had a slightly foggy dark golden color. The head held up petty well. The place I was in was a bit dark so it was hard to see all the finer details of an appearance."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to Grant for sharing this lovely growler treat."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured out of a growler, shared by an extremely generous California BA, poured into a tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","I got to enjoy this monster of a beer, thanks to beachbum1975! "
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance: Pours an enormous sea-foam head that takes quite a while to subside, I quickly gave up the wait and fought my way through. Nice lacing all the way down the glass. I prefer a dirtier IPA with spots and flecks, this one was a clear peach-orange-lemon-amber. I love the sound of a RRBC growler opening."
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled from a growler."
"Pliny The Younger","I don't give up all 5's very often but this one deserves it."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a growler into a big wine glass at 50 F/ 10 C."
"Pliny The Younger","I had this on-tap at Toronado today so run and get some while they still have it! "
"Pliny The Younger","Huge fan of Vinnie and Russain River. I went to the TION night at O'briens and the line to get a tast was out the door, to the street, then down to the back of O'briens, and almost to the restroom. No joke! "
"Pliny The Younger","BIG, Huge Thanks to Abecall98 for providing this in a recent trade. AWESOME trader... Growler sent from CA"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a growler courtesy of tzanio. HUGE thanks!! This guy went out of his way to send me a growler, because he felt he shafted me on our last trade, which he did not. Mega-karma his way!!"
"Pliny The Younger","Huge thanks to Jasonm for sharing this!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Horsebrass"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the brewpub. Served in a 10 oz glass."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad."
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled from a growler in my Double Mountain tulip pint glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to a hot tip, I got to enjoy a couple of the first glasses poured at the Horse Brass Pub. Served in a small nonic glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Wonderful. It's chock full of hop flavor. I've had a number of DIPAs, and this beer expresses hop flavor better than any beer that I've ever tasted."
"Pliny The Younger","I finally got to try the elusive Younger of the Plineys. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at at Downtown Johnny Browns on 02/15/09"
"Pliny The Younger","All Hail RR"
"Pliny The Younger","Oh my!! This beer was hands down the most amazing beer i have ever had. This beer sent me to beer heaven. I feel really bad for the beers that i haven't tried yet because they don't stand a chance!"
"Pliny The Younger","Wow! That is all I can say about this beer. I think I said it about 14 times while sampling it. HUGE thanks to Swnicholson for the growler!!!! "
"Pliny The Younger","ok.... i have waited almost 2 years to try this. HUGE thanks to my homie for sending me this in his own growler! "
"Pliny The Younger","Dont know what else can be said about this one. "
"Pliny The Younger","10 oz pour from Johnny Brown's in San Diego"
"Pliny The Younger","With CrellMoset's before mine, it would make this #200 on here. Shared with Chris and dkachur with Clare. "
"Pliny The Younger","Growler courtesy of urwatuh8 - many, many thanks for perhaps my #1 want. Split several ways w/ dkachur, proteus93, and one other friend (who has just begun to appreciate DIPAs - beeradvocacy at work!!)."
"Pliny The Younger","2009 version. I've had this year's version a couple times, at Beachwood BBQ and Verdugo Bar. The hop aroma is much more pungnet in the nose than I remember, and I can taste a smoother, more balanced beer in this year's version. Some caramel and bready notes emerge alongside with the intense, puckering hops, and it's slightly cleaner too. Overall, I like 2009's version a little more than the 2008 version, and the latter was pretty awesome as well."
"Pliny The Younger","Half pint at Russian River on 02.06.09. Board behind bar listed PiY as 10.5% with GOBS under the I.B.U. One of the most unique colors of beer I have ever seen. No head in sight and the glass was glowing orange. All I could do was stare for a few minutes. While doing this, I could smell Younger from a foot away. Crazy giant boozy grapefruit whiffs. Really. Chewy as hell. Grapefruit taffy. Cascade spearmint jolly rancher. Enormous whopper of a DIPA. Exceptionally drinkable for the size. Had a tulip of Younger Sunday night @ Toronado and could have had 6 more. But what's the point? This beer is the shit."
"Pliny The Younger","A- Pours a super bright, crystal clear golden orange with a nice white head. Not too much in the lacing area though the only thing holding it back."
"Pliny The Younger","Alright, time to review this beer finally. Current batch is drier than the last batch with less sweetness apparent from the malt. Citrusy and resiny hops just dance on your tongue with a beautifully filling yet light malt profile. This does live up to the hype. Better than last year as well. I'm loving this. So go, get yourself a pint of this beautiful beer."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got to have a pint of this one. On tap at Pizza Port San Clemente."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to urwatuh8 for the growler."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got my hands on this one. Called Father's Office, found out it was finally in, and practically threw the lady in the car and raced off. I was not about to miss this. "
"Pliny The Younger","An incredibly huge thanks to Adam (Nanoslug) for sending a fresh growler of this to me. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip."
"Pliny The Younger","22 ounce hand bottle shared by Bobby91w. Pours bright sunny yellow with good whit head. Dank pine and Juicy Fruit nose. Just a big bold blend of hop goodness. Medium body. Balanced finish. Certainly a great beer, I'm just not sure it lived up to my expectations."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a tap into a 4 ounce taster glass...Finally had my chance to taste The Younger, and oh my GOD, what a day to remember. First the sample, then meeting Vinnie...the brewer himself."
"Pliny The Younger","Huge thanks to Scott (swnicholson) for scoring a growler of this for me. Poured from a cool looking growler into my Corsedonk tulip glass."
"Pliny The Younger","I have waited over a year since I moved to the Bay area to have this beer and I was at Toronado the day they received the kegs. RR delivers on Thursdays to Toronado btw...might be good to know from time to time."
"Pliny The Younger","HUGE thanks goes out to bifrostguard for this and his FIRST trade! Delivered on my doorstep on Saturday 2/7/2009 and shared with pwoods (&lt;-- this guys owes me a shit ton! Just kidding), DrewOSU and Ftownthrowdown."
"Pliny The Younger","Got another one of the always welcomed infamous emails/calls! These get togethers are starting to become epic!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap tonight at Monk's Kettle. "
"Pliny The Younger","Huge thanks goes out to a very helpful and patient BA, largadeer. Thanks again Chris!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Sonoma Wine Exchange (Wine Exchange of Sonoma?). Pours a yellow to orange and transparent, with a nice white head. Sticky, sticky lacing. Clear and gleaming in the light. Smells very hoppy, citrusy, but also very heavy on the alcohol. Some pine notes. Flavor is quite good. Very bitter, very hoppy. Citrus hops dominate, but again there's a pine sap presence too. Hops blow out my taste buds pretty early on. More of a malt profile than the Elder and definitely a more prominent alcohol presence too. The massive hops and alcohol don;t really work to its benefit, imo. Elder is a great beer because of how it manages to cram all that good stuff in and not be overwhelming, while Younger IS overwhelming. Still, its very tasty, just more on the overly aggressive side of things. Full bodied, but also a bit syrupy. Drinks well, but again, i prefer the elder."
"Pliny The Younger","Managed to get this at the brewery within the one week they had it on tap. A beautiful ride up through Sonoma County with apogee of a great beer."
"Pliny The Younger","a - bright golden color, fairly clear with a slight haze, good sized white head with very good retention and lacing"
"Pliny The Younger","My 100th review! WOW! And the perfect beer to enjoy on such an occasion. I had the chance to enjoy this beer twice. Once on 2/6/09 at Hollingshead in Orange, and yesterday (2/10/09) at Beachwood BBQ. This a combination review from both tastings. "
"Pliny The Younger","The downright worship of this beer is remarkable to me. A girl at the bar sounded like she was having an orgasm after each sip. But on to the beer."
"Pliny The Younger","A - pours the exact same color as Elder but with less head and very little lacing"
"Pliny The Younger","on tap at the Toronado SF."
"Pliny The Younger","oh day of days the younger has come to town. as I sit here with my buddy olie I wonder about this beer. how can anything be this good in liquid form. easy younger can be."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado. First keg tapping of 2009 in the yay area...Reprazent."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Toronado. Poured into a tulip glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally...the elusive ""Younger""."
"Pliny The Younger","Served on tap at O'brien's TION night in a 10oz taster. One of the first pours of 2009, I almost didn't want to drink it. The first keg blew in 7 minutes..."
"Pliny The Younger","A- this is the best looking IPA period!!!It glows."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capone's. "
"Pliny The Younger","Perfect 5 you say?! Well, I'll let you guys in on a little secret. I cheated a little bit, filling out these scores. Don't tell anybody, though... the truth is, I may have had beers that looked better than Pliny the Younger. (/sarcasm)"
"Pliny The Younger","Sometimes a beer kept in such high regard can falter when actually faced with reality. This beer somehow became even better than the old stories I had heard for years befor having the chance to try it out. "
"Pliny The Younger","Served in a large mouth glass, the head was firm and perched on a nice golden pedistal."
"Pliny The Younger","Drank on-tap at Stone Brewing (Just freakin' 8oz pint glass. I want BIGGER!!!). "
"Pliny The Younger","Another tasty treat found at The Liars Club after CBC 2008 in San Diego."
"Pliny The Younger","Thank the heavens, finally some Pliny! Thank you, Lucky B's!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Bistro DIPA festival."
"Pliny The Younger","On-tap at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena, CA. "
"Pliny The Younger","Naja's Place - 3/28/08"
"Pliny The Younger","on draught in a pint glass"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Naja's! I was excited."
"Pliny The Younger","A: Crystal clear golden/light amber color with a very nice thick white head; especially from a growler. There is pretty decent carbonation. It is a bit lighter than I expected."
"Pliny The Younger","Props to DrSeamus for sharing his growler."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to Drseamus for bringing the west coast love."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at O'Briens, San Diego."
"Pliny The Younger","3/1/08: What a day here in Denver. We spent our time outside enjoying the 74 degree winter heat, had some friends over for a barbecue, threw some darts, drank beer, played basketball with the kids, could it get any better? Yes, yes it can. The mailman delivered a package, not just any package, this was beer mail. Ladies and gentlemen, Pliny the Younger is in the building!"
"Pliny The Younger","Huge thanks to rayjay for getting a growler of this to me in the mid west. He hooked me up with some great beers, but this was the best one he sent me"
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a crystal clear and glowing amber orange. Big carbonation bubbles come up and a thin white head caps it off, leaving sticky spots of lacing all down the glass. I can only imagine straight from the tap."
"Pliny The Younger","While in Santa Rosa I visited the brewpub and filled my Growler, brought it home and poured a small glass. I have waited a long time for this to be available and it was worth the wait. Without a doub this is the best over the top DIPA I have ever partaken, and this is my favorite beer type. Poured a hazy gold tending toward orange with a soap suds head that left big chucks of lacing. Huge citrus hops nose, and a rich mouthfeel that feels like port wine on the palate. Flavors are citrus hops and the finish is long and bitter, but enjoyably so. I was prepared to be disappointed after the long wait, but this is the best brew ever for me. So sad I only have a growler. I really love this beer. I was going to save a 5.0 for the very best. This is it!"
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance - pours a hazed light orange amber. Very little head, but after transfers from tap to growler to bottle to glass, well, I can be forgiving. A thin layer of bubbles appears and kind of limps off to the side."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks a million to jwolfie70 for providing me the chance to try this rarity. Also, thanks to SirChugsAlot, kersta8, dsigmon, beavers, and NJpadreFan for the kind words in the thread that SirChugsAlot made. jwolfie70 saw that thread and decided to offer me the growler. So, Thanks everyone!"
"Pliny The Younger","We are, we are...youth of the nation. On tap at O'Brien's in San Diego. Poured a somewhat hazy orange color. A good head when poured although did dissipate during the tasting. Some viscous sticks to the glass when you swirl it."
"Pliny The Younger","So I finally got to try this at hollingshead"
"Pliny The Younger","Enjoyed on tap at Hollingsheads. Poured clear orange with ample but short lived head. I'm amazed a beer so hoppy can be perfectly clear like this."
"Pliny The Younger","Served to me in a Chimay chalice at Hollingshead's."
"Pliny The Younger","What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? I believe this is my third or fourth year having it, and it has always been incredible."
"Pliny The Younger","$5 pint at O'Brien's. Now, last night I started feeling congested and felt a cold coming but I was still able to taste/smell fairly well."
"Pliny The Younger","I enjoyed a half liter of this at Hollingshead today. I have never had a sip of alcohol at work for my entire life, but given that I expected this to be a once a year opportunity, I made an exception. Halfway through, the barkeep casually mentioned that they actually received five kegs instead of their usual one. So it goes."
"Pliny The Younger",2-13-08
"Pliny The Younger","An exeptional beer. It pours a deep red copper, with a small white head. The smell is dominated by floral hops. The taste is definitely sweet, but it is balanced out nicely by a very strong floral hop taste that keeps the beer from being too sweet. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops. The beer leaves a hop stickiness coat on your mouth. Definitely a beer that I would recommend trying."
"Pliny The Younger","12 ounce pour at Hollingshead's Delicatessen in the city of Orange for a whopping seven dollars after tax, 16 ounce pours were nine plus tax though, expesnive but definitely worth every penny"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured off the tap at Pizza Port C'bad on 2-9-08. Poured into pint glass a golden color with no head by the time the bartender handed it to me but a lot of cotton candy lacing. Smell is like running through the NorCal forests of Humbolt while holding an grapefruit in one hand and in the other pineapple.( in other words giant forest pine aroma mixed with grapefruit, citrus, and tropical fruits.) The Taste was pine resin hoppy at first with a monster sweet malty backbone. But as it warmed up the bitterness took effect adding layers of citrus rinds to the pine flavor with the sweetness still there but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is as full as a TIPA could be without being cloy or overdone, it was sticky with a light creamy carbonation. Considering its 11% ,extremely hoppy and bitter, with a giant malt backbone this beers has a balance of those extreme features that keeps it from being a one hitter quitter beer."
"Pliny The Younger","I was skeptical of the hype for this beer but cutting to"
"Pliny The Younger","Bright peachy orange color. Nice fresh hop aroma, leans toward ripe citrus but also some earthy/herbal notes too. Nose is clean, citrus hops, with a permeating but pleasant bitterness that carries some ripe tangerine flavors. Slightly viscous, full mouthfeel. Malt provides perfect vehicle for all the hops, without getting in the way. Really nice hop complexity with the perfect amount of bitterness to finishing ratio. Hop flavors are complex, with leafy earth and pine coming through after initially ripe citrus burst. While this IPA is a whopping 11% abv, it is not overly sticky, cloying, or too sweet, and the alcohol is almost undetectable. Probably one of the best versions of the strong IPA style I've had, and almost worthy of its reputation, but not the lines and inconvenience of many of the release events. Tasted @ Toronado 2/2/08."
"Pliny The Younger","Served on-tap at the Toronado on 2/2/08."
"Pliny The Younger","A- Tangerine colored brew pours with a light head which dissapates fairly quickly with some lacing."
"Pliny The Younger",WOW!!
"Pliny The Younger","Golden-amber in the glass with the faintest hop haze and a quarter-inch of white froth. Head retention is very good for such a high gravity beer, and the brightness and clarity are impressive."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to weeare138 for this one."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this beer a couple of times at some beer tastings in the East."
"Pliny The Younger","12 oz. pour, at Hollingshead Delicatessen,"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a home bottled younger some months ago but never recorded. Recording on revisiting it this evening."
"Pliny The Younger","Clear faded orange liquid with quickly rising bubbles. A frothy bright white head rises up thickly and settles down to a firm half inch cap."
"Pliny The Younger","OH MY GOSH!! [sorry about the cap lock, intentional though]"
"Pliny The Younger","Props to Redwood George for getting a bottle of this to someone in the Chicago area!!!"
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a pale, hazy gold. Creamy head of white foam sits steady."
"Pliny The Younger","Had on cask at Naja's Place on my 21st birthday."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capones in Norristown, PA."
"Pliny The Younger","Nice golden color with an off-white head that retains well and leaves a decent lacing. Absolutely mind blowing aroma. Full of citrus; grapefruit and pine and other aromas I can't hardly begin to describe are not only blended perfectly, but are powerful enough to greet your tongue from a foot away. Amazing taste of aforementioned aromas with a strong, yet amazing bitterness. The bitterness seemed like it came in waves; extremely bitter, but only pleasant bitterness, not harsh at all. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a dry finish, leaving you wanting more and more once the explosion of taste leaves your mouth. I would drink the hell out of this if given the opportunity. "
"Pliny The Younger","HUGE THANKS to todd1 for this growler. You are a god among men, sir."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Capone's 4/18/07."
"Pliny The Younger","Second of a group of growlers donated by kind hosts to the beer-sampling cause after being retrieved by a long road trip several days prior. Carbonation levels somewhat lower due to this treatment. Still sampled in reasonable condition and without having to take a personal trip down to Philly to have some. "
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled on-tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA on 4-18-07 as part of a side by side comparison with Pliny the Elder. This review is from notes taken that night."
"Pliny The Younger","Many thanks to redwoodgeorge and mntlover for making this possible."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a clear copper/golden color with a solid inch off-white sticky head. I honestly didn't spend much time eyeing this one as the aroma when the bottle cap was popped kind of put me into a trance. Wonderful punget hoppy aroma. The aroma almost dares you and invites you at the same time."
"Pliny The Younger","Presentation: Standard pint from tap"
"Pliny The Younger","Advertised as a triple ipa at hollingshead's. Nice hoppiness on the nose and mouth. The hop level is high, but the cascades (with another hop that I don't know) make it citrusy and easy to drink. A lot of ipas are just hop bombs with nothing else. This beer is a hop monster, but has enough malting (especially a delicate caramel malting) behind it to not just be hop oil. The alcohol presence is also not too extreme even though this an 11 percent abv beer. This beer is a work of art and you need to go out and drink it. Stop reading my review and go drink it NOW!"
"Pliny The Younger","I have had this beer four separate times. I have in front of me four separate pages of notes and my head is swirling with how to put this all together. Twice I did a side by side with the Elder and the Younger. Clearly these are two, TERRIFIC beers! The Younger is the strong muscular, steroid juicing aggressive loud ostentatious, sibling to the more refined, Elder brother. Pliny The Younger gets right in your face and smacks you around until you pay attention. Wow!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Hollingshead Deli in Orange County, CA."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Union Jack's on the Manatawny. Presented in a wine glass. Appears a rich golden amber-yellow with a finger of fluffy white head. Smells of grapefruit, apricot, pineapple and sweet malt. Tastes of the same fruits evident in the nose, predominantly grapefruit, alcohol. Just about the perfect balance of piney, fruity hops, and rich caramel malt. Finish is very dry. Moderate in both body and carbonation. What a sublime DIPA."
"Pliny The Younger","A growler filled at the Union Jack's Inn On The Manatawny. Thanks to Phatz for sharing it."
"Pliny The Younger","poured into a flaired gold rimmed tulip glass from a growler at Phatz's Pliny Project 2."
"Pliny The Younger","A growler filled at the Union Jack's Inn On The Manatawny. Thanks to Phatz for sharing it."
"Pliny The Younger","on-tap at Pizza Port Carlesblad. The more aggressive version of the elder in a side-by-side tasting. Hop attack of the palate, and a lot of malt. Powerful hop attack, common amoung the double IPAs I have had, is not satisfying to me. The elder is much smoother, and now my favorite. White head. You don't detect the alcohol in the taste, but it's there!"
"Pliny The Younger","Much thanks to jgaston for the growler!"
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance: Light amber/golden color and very clear with smallish white head that stays around and provides some slight lacing."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Liars Club. Served in a 10 oz snifter. This is a true hop heads dream. the smell is strongly of west coast hops, piney, citrusy. The hops dominate the smell as they do the taste. you dont get too much of the malt here but the hops are what you are looking for in a 2XIPA. This just tastes like fresh hops smell. The alcohol is there, but not in a bad way. I could get really drunk by dowining alot of these"
"Pliny The Younger","I've had every batch of Pliny the Younger and I wasn't about to miss out on this latest one."
"Pliny The Younger","Again, big thanks to mcallister and pixel for having us over and letting me sample this prize. Much of this review compares the younger to the elder. Younger again is gold in color, maybe a bit lighter. Nice thick white head, which held together very well. Great piney aroma, not quite as much citrus as the elder. Very sweet, a huge malt backbone. Piney and citrusy hops, but without as much peach flavor as the elder. Nice full body. Big, but not boozy, the alcohol is very well hidden. This is very enjoyable, and I understand why this is rated so highly."
"Pliny The Younger","A - Pours a brilliantly clear golden orange with a 2-3 finger white head and spotty lacing through the finish."
"Pliny The Younger","Good looking indeed. Nicely carbonated with a large white and fluffy head that leaves some sticky lace behind. "
"Pliny The Younger","Served on Cask at Naja's Place in Redondo Beach."
"Pliny The Younger","Wow! On cask this beer takes a different form. I love it from the tap, but I find it difficult to drink more than one. From the cask, the smoothness allows for many pints. The ABV does not."
"Pliny The Younger","Served on-tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia in a 10-ounce tulip-type glass."
"Pliny The Younger","I was lucky enough to have this delicious beer at the Grey Lodge in Northeast Philadelphia. Props to them for bringing in the goods. I must admit that I had a pint of the Younger immediately after a pint of the Elder, so my palate was certainly well worked over. However..."
"Pliny The Younger","This is based on notes from The Drafting Room and The Grey Lodge."
"Pliny The Younger","Clear orange with a thin, cream coloured head. Spotty lacing was evident from the fine bubbles, which showed excellent retention. The aroma was all hops - powdery, floral, tangerine, pine, and grapefruit, not necessarily all at the same time though. There was a lot of malt sweetness up front, but a very strong bitterness hits at the same time. Floral and citrusy hop flavour fills the midsection, with mild pine, orange and tangerine. Spicy alcohol appears towards the end and grapefruit bitterness really lingers. Full bodied served with moderately low carbonation and significant alcohol warmth and numbing. Drying hop finish with slight stickiness. This is really good, really powerful. Highly drinkable for such a big beer. Everything is just turned up on this beer - a lot. I think I prefer the Elder as a beer I could drink on a regular basis - this one seems to be fit more for special occasions. I'd be a happy dude if I could get either on a regular basis..."
"Pliny The Younger","I had this on-tap at The Drafting Room. My glass was filled with a golden copper color liquid with a thin white head. Some lacing was left but not like the amount left by the Elder. The aroma was filled with pine and citrus from the hops and a sweet caramel / tofffee scent. The flavor followed the smell. Hops were there but so was the sweetness. Somewhere in between a 90 min. and a 120 min. with the sweetness. Very smooth and not as bitter IMO as the Elder. The abv in this one (11%) limited me to only two glasses but they were tasty. Great brew, but I think the Elder comes out on top."
"Pliny The Younger","Served on tap. Appeared copper color with a grapefruit smell and taste. The alcohol wasn't overwhelming at 11 percent and I considered it very drinkable. ."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Tria in Philadelphia, served in a 13 oz tulip glass. The beer poured a vibrant copper color, clear and with a thick off white head that disapated slowly and gave way to a nice ring around the end and a swirly island in the middle. The aroma was a strong pine and citrus nose that was similar to the Elder but kicked up a bit and more pure and extreme but enjoyable. The taste was very similar to the taste. There was the initial hoppy, piney taste with some citrus, grapefruit and a touch of sweet caramel. The mouth feel was very smooth with a nice alcohol burn on the way down that tells you this is a 11% beer. What a smooth ride the Younger was. I was expecting this to be hard to handle but found this very enjoyable and drinkable. I had 2 in this sitting and will go back for more wherever I can find it. Another RR hit and it has been a long time that I have waited to try this."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured a bright golden color with a medium sized, creamy, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of piney hops, citrus fruits, tons of resin, caramel malts, and light alcohol. Strong pine in the taste, more citrus fruits, bitter grapefruits, with some sweet malts, and alcohol in the finish. Much more enjoyable than DFH 120."
"Pliny The Younger","Despairing over not being able to get this on tap at the RR brewpub, I was overjoyed to find it on tap at Toronado in San Francisco."
"Pliny The Younger","I had this on tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach. It was presented in a tumbler, and had a pale orange color with a thin foam comprised of big bubbles. The beer was very clear which I guess I didn't expect."
"Pliny The Younger","Much thanks to hopdog for this hand filled bottle...don't know if/when I would ever see it on draft around here."
"Pliny The Younger","I was pretty excited when I saw this on tap at the Toronado towards the end of their barleywine fest. Pours a hazy golden copper body, with a white fluffy head. Tremendous aroma, delicious west coast style hops. peachy, grapefruit, intense. First taste, so smooth, you don't notice the 11% abv at all. Tremendous beer, probably the best DIPA I've ever had."
"Pliny The Younger","From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Appearance: Arrives at the table with a hazy light amber body, a solid head and lots of splashy lacing"
"Pliny The Younger","thx george"
"Pliny The Younger","22oz bottle obtained via trade with RedwoodGeorge. Thanks for the opportunity... Brewed 1/3/2006, hand-bottled via counter-pressure system 1/19/06."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to RedwoodGeorge for this handbottled bomber, counterpressure filled from a keg and sent off to me. Pliny The Younger pours from the bomber an amazingly clear bright orange/peach color with a half inch of frothy bubbly white head on top. Slow carbonation rises up to meet some sticky lacing. Aromas of beautiful, vibrant hop cones attack my senses with bold citrus, grapefruit and pine needle aromas. A sweet, slighty doughy caramel undercurrent is present as well. Quite possibly hop nirvana. Green, leafy, floral and quite simply enchanting. Wow."
"Pliny The Younger","1/2 Gallon growler. Mild peach color, bordering on orange. Unbelievable hop aroma, loads of fruit, particular grapefruit and orange. The aroma is very vibrant and fresh, but also extremely dry, emphasis of an enormous and ridiculous dry hop, which we all know Vinnie has trademarked. The body is very rich and full, giving not only malt balance, but a variety of rich malt flavors, especially caramel and toffee, along with a light fruit platter. The hop character is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous, but in such an unbelievably great way. Wow, such a hop monster, but still balanced in a completely maniacal way."
"Pliny The Younger","Received from the BA's BA, RedwoodGeorge, as part of his recent Home Bottling Project. Thanks a million George for bringing smiles to this hoppy beer lover, along with many others."
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled thanks to RedwoodGeorge and his most Excellent trade!"
"Pliny The Younger","I recently had the pleasure of enjoying this lovely beer in a lovely 2 liter Russian River growler. Shared samples with some friends at Bethlehem Brew Works, then revisited it a few days later so I could write about it. "
"Pliny The Younger","Pliny the Younger made the journey across the country in a 22 oz. bomber, bottled from a 5 liter keg using a counterpressure filler by BA RedwoodGeorge. While the bottling was unofficial, the beer coming out of bomber was in a very good shape. The head was one finger thick, which is a little small for the style, but it did stay put for a good little while. The underlying body was clear pale orange, and well carbonated. The looks were classic DIPA, while aroma took the style up a few notches. The smell was enticingly grapefruity, and peppery, with a very sweet smelling malt backbone. The juiciness of the smell was certainly mouth watering, and the taste did not disappoint. Quite citric and pungent, the hop laden flavor was cut by a lot of malt sweetness. The low perceived bitterness and well hidden alcohol made for an easy to drink brew. The mouthfeel was sticky, minerally, and thick, with a peppercorn zest in the aftertaste. With so much to enjoy in each sip, there was nothing to complain about the time that I had draining my imperial pint. The alcohol only became evident as the beer came near room temperature, but never did it feel like an obtrusive spoilsport. This drank much easier than the 10.5% strength it possessed would have suggested. A craft brewing masterpiece that deserves all the hype it gets. This beer was big, but still in a very delicate state of balance. Muscular, clean, and beautiful, there was none of the sloppy flab in here found in so many big beers. A Charlize Theron among beers."
"Pliny The Younger","Presentation: A Growler freshly plundered and expertly filled at Hollingshead Deli in Orange this past weekend. "
"Pliny The Younger","To me, this is the perfect beer. I've since had 7 growlers of it from Hollingshead and am finally reviewing."
"Pliny The Younger","Was very pleased to find this at a favorite little place of ours, Pleasantons Main Street Brewery. Nice crysal clear light amber color was topped by a nice white head that retained well and left nice patterns of lace. Aroma, hops hops and more hops. Very piney and inviting. Taste, very hoppy with emphasis on the pine, fantastic freash taste and very smooth despite the high bittering. Not thick and viscous like some other beers of theis type can be. How can I give a average drinkability score to a beer that tastes exceptional? Well I don't think beers in the 11% realm are the kind you sit around and knock back. This is a great beer but I don't look to get ripped on one brew."
"Pliny The Younger","Tasted on tap 1/28/06 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. $4.50 for a 25 cl ""half"" order."
"Pliny The Younger","Finally got a sample of the all mighty ""Younger"" from the Liar's Club in Mission Beach @$2.75 a glass, can't beat it."
"Pliny The Younger","After months of patience, I finally got the chance to try this fine beer. I had it on tap at the Liars Club. All I can say is wow."
"Pliny The Younger","appearance: that's a fine looking glass of beer, that can't be denied. Pours a nice pale, slightly amber color. That is some haziness to it, the hoppier the beer the more hazy. poured in to a pair of pint glasses to share with my dad. that head stayed along time."
"Pliny The Younger","This beer pours a golden color with a nice head that falls quickly but leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very well balanced with the high level of hops and maltiness. Smells very nice. The flavor is much the same. Very hoppy and resiny, but the malt backing is just right to make it very well balanced. Finish is very bitter. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is very good for the abv."
"Pliny The Younger","Served on tap at the Brickskeller in DC in a pint glass. Cellar temps, to boot."
"Pliny The Younger","Thanks to Kmpitz2 for sharing his growler...I wouldn't have done it for him. This beer is just too good. I have often criticized Double IPA's for trying to acheive balance when IPA's are supposed to be completely out of balance. This beer taught me better. Sweet and bitter can come together in a great IPA. The look is solid but to be expected straw, golden with a haze and incredible head retention. Aroma is bitter and hop flavored solidly, but not to knock your socks off. A boquet of hops is the fullest and roundest that I have had without intimidation. The flavor is a combination of sweet malts that hinge on confectionate sugar and cotton candy with a yeasty (almost musky) aura about it that adds much complexity. The hops give tremendous, but not sharp, bittering and pine, oak, nut, ginger, nutmeg, and pepper flavors. The carbonation always kept the beer soft and creamy. Never prickley or hot. Finishes a combined sweet and bitter. Not as drying as you'd think. The high alcohols hit only in the aftertaste and never become fusal or too sweet. This is truely and ideal beer."
"Pliny The Younger","Pours a hazy peach color with a 2 finger white head taht sticks around very well. Just doesn't look dark enough for me. Nose is sweet and hoppy. Citrusy sweet with a nice caramel background. Light notes of earthyness from the hop. Decent spun sugar sweetness. Very enticing IIPA. Flavor is all about balance. Citrusy hop and deep sweet caramel malt blast initially, with just a touch of earthyness from hop. It fades to a mellow caramel sweetness and moderate, but very calm and mellow bitter on the finish. Wow. Everything is in awesome harmony. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. Bitter hangs on just long enough to beckon me back in. Burps are also all about the balance...sweet and hoppy. Drinkability is way too good on this one. Just looked and saw the 11% and I don't believe it. Hot damn. I am very pleased with this to say the least."
"Pliny The Younger","A huge thanks to Kev for sharing this one. Also thanks to Lou91 for bringing this from Cali! 2L growler poured into a snifter. It pours a hazy medium orange color with two fingers of head. There's a decent amount of lacing. The smell is pure hop juice. Hop oil is what you get here! I'm lovin' every bit. If I knew what heroin was like, this would probably be damn close. The taste is also chock full of hops. The maltiness is there just enough to hold the beer together, but the hops shine through. No alcohol in sight, it's unreal. The mouthfeel is so thick and heavy. Just wow. The drinkability is beyond all awesomeness. I cannot believe this is an 11% brew. Lies I tell you! All lies!!! A really really fantastic beer."
"Pliny The Younger","I was lucky enough to have a friend bring me a growler of this, last month after a trip to Northern California. Immediately after opening the growler the hop punch hit me. A bouquet of hops almost overwhelm me. It poured a golden haze while the aroma continued to permeate my senses. The balanced foam head filled out what looked to be a picturebook painting of what a pint should look like. The scents still swimming around my nose: piney, gorgeous hops with a slight citrus undertone. It was a complex aroma that was truly remarkable. "
"Pliny The Younger","Huge-ass growler courtesy of RedwoodGeorge. You are a prince among men."
"Pliny The Younger","Many thanks go to RedwoodGeorge for this wonderful fresh 67.6 oz/ 2 liters of pure heaven on earth."
"Pliny The Younger","Ap: Hazy straw color, nice white head, fades pretty quickly, but hangs on exceptionally long for an 11% ABV brew. Collar remains indefinitely. Bubbles rise to the surface at a slow pace due to the apparent viscosity of this big brew. "
"Pliny The Younger","Used 5 tickets to sample at the ABF. This is a combining of the notes I took each time.."
"Pliny The Younger","thee triple ipa of the west coast, had it on tap at the toronado's 18th birthday. served in a tulip. "
"Pliny The Younger","One 1/2 pint wasn't enough, so I had a second."
"Pliny The Younger","I had this beer served off of a hand pump at Naja's in Redondo beach served in a 8oz chimay glass. I have no idea how they could possibly improve this beer. OUTSTANDING. "
"Pliny The Younger","Sampled (a few times!) at the ABF. One of a very select few beers I bothered to review while attending the ABF. Pliny The Younger was served up at the VIP session of the ABF."
"Pliny The Younger","I swear, I want to have Pliny's alien love child. Forget that I'm male and have never met an alien."
"Pliny The Younger","Had this bottle at American Beer Fest in Boston."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured from a growler imported by brewandbbq from the sacred hop grounds of Russian River . . ."
"Pliny The Younger","Poured light gold and hazy from the growler, white, rocky head with a myriad of different sized bubbles. Quickly settled down to a thin whisp of carbonation."
"Pliny The Younger","once poured from the growler, the brew slipped over the lip of the pint, and I had to suck up some...pre-inspection, I'm wowed by this beer! Holy dribble cup, Batman!"
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at O'Briens. Served in 10oz glasses. (2nd batch)"
"Pliny The Younger","Poured a clean light orange with a nice fluffy head. Laces all the way down. This smells like hops. Hops, hops, and more hops- it has the signature cascade piney hop smell, very citrusy. This is what God must drink when he wants an IPA. Massive hops, but very very smooth. Whereas some IIPAs are over the top and almost undrinkable, this 3IPA is bitter but very flavorful, with fruity notes and floral-piney-citrus-juicy taste with a clean bitterness in the back. Its well balanced and not overly extreme. The drinkability is high. Too high. So high in fact, that the bartender (who knows me very well) warned me that it would go down easy for an 11% brew. I could not taste a single % of that 11. I could drink this all night, but that would probably result in alcohol poisoning. "
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at the Russian River Brewing Company..."
"Pliny The Younger","On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. "
"Pliny The Younger","Poured a hazy golden buutterscotch color with a creamy white head. Sheets of lace down the glass."
"Pliny The Younger","Served at Naja's, Redondo Beach in 8oz. (owner approved) servings and unlimited at O'Brien's, San Diego in 10oz sevings. When first in posession of this beer, I had NO idea what a triple IPA was supposed to taste like. I thought maybe a Dogfish Head 120 or a Rogue I2PA? No. This beer is amazing in color, smell, taste and drinkability. I've tried pretty much every Double IPA that I could get my hands on and I was convinced that a tie between PizzaPort's: Frank and Pliny the Elder was fair. Those are GREAT beers but Younger follows after Elder and is simply astonishing and amazingly well balanced."
"Pliny The Younger","This is not beer, it is hop juice. That said, it is the tastiest thing I have ever put in my mouth. Had on tap at Lucky Baldwins."
"Pliny The Younger","A stout, small top covers up the ruby-tinted, dry and sticky orange frosted body. Nose is sweet constantness in a mighty, floral hop blast."
"Pliny The Younger","Billed as a Triple IPA with an ABV of 11.0% according to the taphandle."
"Pliny The Younger","01/27/05- Purchased at the Toronado on tap. I need to mark this date in my palm pilot as the day I had the best beer ever created by a human."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","This is worth the hype. The aroma is off the chart good. Cinnamon is delicious and this reminds me of a snickerdoodle cookie. Tons of chocolate as well with subdued pepper, creamy vanilla, and subtle barrel in a medium plus mouth feel. I'm not tasting anything really complex but this is excellent and the cinnamon and vanilla make it a real treat."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Had a pour at the Shelton Fest, and this is one of the best beers that I have tasted. Coffee/cinnamon and barrel notes up front with some spice on the end (absolutely perfect balance). This beer is surprisingly drinkable given the ABV and flavor profile. Absolutely worth the hype."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Solid full mouth feel; chocolate, raisin and pepper---delicious; Shelton fest 8/18/17"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","5oz pour into a snifter. "
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2017 bottle shared amongst friends."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","among the very best beers by ranking because now i am quite convinced that it is one of the very best beers! it is absolutely incredible, huge thanks to my homie in saint louis for sharing this one with me, its one of those beers that due to limited production and insane hype, i thought i might never get to try! so glad i did. i was keen on the base beer, but these barrels take it to the next level. fudge brownie or cake batter comes to mind right away, the cocoa and the vanilla together really make it rich and desserty, but synergies abound in this one. the vanilla notes in the whiskey and the actual vanilla, the subtle rye harshness and the spice of the ancho pepper. the smoked element in the pepper and the earthy bitter cacao nibs, the barrel char and the black malts, and the chocolate and the cinnamon together is also an extremely unique interaction! so much going on here, all fudgey and gooey and dense. the booze is little more than warming, the oak envelopes the whole thing, and i feel cozied, snuggled by this beast. cinnamon and soft smoke linger with a charred character in the end, subtle maple and molasses notes, dark ra chocolate, and smooth mellow wood. its all so good, takes an absurdly well done base beer to the next level. i am not often one to clamour for barrels or freak out about them, but this really is a transformation and a maturation unlike any other. an absolute delight, i hope to encounter this one again!!! hands down the king of the adjunct stouts..."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","look: Very similar to regular abraxas. super dark pour with a small but potent burnt brown head."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","This one was just straight cinnamon for me.  Needs more time I think to get more complex.  It was a 2017 bottle.  Look was nice, cinnamon on the nose."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2017 version.  I have to admit was underwhelmed with this beer.  To me it was completely dominated by cinnamon with some barrel presence.  I had one sip and was like tasted like cinnamon toast crunch soaked in whiskey. Not that is a bad thing.  Still a great beer and maybe it needs more time to integrate other flavors.  It was solid, but I thought it fell a tad short of a world class stout. I actually enjoyed the rich, rye fudginess of Maman 16 over this guy."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2017 Vintage from Bottle:"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","This 2017 batch is a cinnamon bomb. You can taste every aspect of the drying, crackling cassia bark, and it overwhelms the other facets of the beer. I've heard previous batches were more balanced. But maybe Perennial decided to lean into the Cinnamon Toast Crunch descriptors and went a bit overboard on this one. Can't say it wasn't a stinkin' delicious cinnamon stout, though."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","No wax, 2016 bottle. Poured from a 750mL glass into a Perennial stemmed wine glass. "
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2013 bottle."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Absolutely world class! Pitch black with a mocha head. Looks viscous. Cinnamon and barrel all up in my nose. Taste is simply amazing. Cinnamon, cacao and barrel. Nothing overwhelming....perfectly balanced. Mouth is spot on. Just the perfect viscosity. Outstanding beer...honestly one of the best I've had."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Nice bouquet of dark fruits.  Rich and robust front palate with raisin and a firm dusting of cinnamon from mid to back. The ancho was probably perfect for my taste, adding just a little ""grip"" to the overall drink.  Not as dense as other BA stouts I have had, but great finesse.  "
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","There's no messing around with this one.  It's a heavy duty, great and powerful, sludge til ya can't budge dessert in a glass kind of beer.  Chocolate and vanilla fudge brownies with a little coconut on top, and that's what you're drinking.  Thick, slick, and drinkable forever."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Bottled February 2016; drank 4/29/16 @ Locked Whispers. "
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Top five beers I have ever had right here. Imagine if you took Abraxas and made brownies out of it. Ridiculous bourbon and chocolate flavors and heavy mouth feel that couples very well with the base flavors."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Rating #2000. Bottled 2/2016"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Wow.  Poured into a snifter at the brewery. Practically no head or lacing, and very little carbonation. The pepper is very subtle, more heat than taste. The chocolate cools the heat very nicely. Coats the mouth, tongue, throat, stomach...who am I kidding, it was a big fuzzy blanket, a hot tub in a snow storm,  a hot toddy and a beautiful red head all rolled into one."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","I don't rate many beers but this one is just to good not too. Lives up to they hype and comes through on all levels."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","L: pitch black, no head"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2016 vintage"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Delicious cinnamon flavor. The barrel takes some of the sweetness off making this a superbly balanced beer. Fantastic!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","There are no adequate words to describe the awesomeness of this amazing beer.  I truly believe it is only a matter of time before BA Abraxas finds itself rightfully at the very top of the BA Top 250 list.  And once it gets to the top, like Hulk Hogan in the mid/late 80's, expect it to stay there."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","There are many great BA stouts out there, but I would say this might top the list. Nothing overpowers itself, the bourbon, cinnamon, and chilies all work in perfect combination. Great cinnamon up front, with a smooth well hidden abv on the back end. Amazing!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2014 waxed bottle"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","I don't usually say much when rating a beer but this beer was amazing. Good base beer and the barrel brings it to a whole new level. If you like thick chewy BA stouts , get it! this one is well worth the price of admission"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2016 vintage, poured from the bottle into a taster. All the flavors from the base beer come out but muted with an added layer of complexity from the barrel. Excellent!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Worth the hype. So much better than the base beer. Barrel mutes the spice and balances it. Not quite worth the price of admission, but at this level, not much truly is!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","L:  Black with minimal head"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Thank you God!!!!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Holy cow! In a night worthy of any share I've ever been a part of, which included DBH, Westly, Hommage, DBJ, Remy Pappy, Pappy Cake and more, this was the clear winner! It wasn't even close and we drank some amazing beer tonight. Cinnamon Toast Crunch mixed with an amazingly smooth bourbon barrel stout, with some slight pepper heat added in for good measure. One of the best beers I've ever had hands down and I previously rated DBH a 5 (the only 5 I've ever given). I stood by that 5 tonight until I had the BA Abraxas. If DBH is a 5 (which I still think it is) BA Abraxas is a 7. Do whatever you need to do to experience this masterpiece."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2016 vintage drank in a snifter on 4/29/2016"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","L: Dark black with minimal head"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","I don't know what else I can say about this beer that already hasn't been said.  It's all the flavors of regular Abraxas pulled together and mellowed out perfectly by the barrel aging process.  One of the richest, thickest, most flavorful beers I've ever had.  The rye whiskey notes balance perfectly with the aroma and taste of the chili, chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Undoubtedly the best stouts I've ever had the pleasure of tasting, and the 2016 is just as good or better than the 2014.  I count myself fortunate to have had both a taste on draft and taken home a bottle today.  Epic brew.  Hall of fame worthy."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Finally got to try this one and yes, I'm ""adding to the hype train"" with my rating, but it is very well deserved.   Having lucked out and tasted regular Abraxas so many times, to me the difference with Barrel-Aged Abraxas is subtle.  The barrel flavors hide much of the cinnamon sweetness, which then allows the chili heat to shine a little more on the back end."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","From a split bottle at sp cellar. On the heels on derivation 2, so there's that."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","If you're into heavy and rich beers, this is the best around. Very dark color, extremely rich body. The chiles and cinnamon stick give this beer a unique finish with some bite."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Had this side by side with Abraxas and it tasted to me as if the barrel did not leave an imprint but amplified the base beer. Strong chocolate and cinnamon, with an immense amount of coffee and roast. It's as if you are drinking an after dinner coffee with a chocolate, caramel, vanilla and toffee dessert. Light heat from the chile's but it helps to liven the experience."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Let it warm up a bit.  It had a little too much of a bite on it till it warmed up a bit.  Once warmed, it smoothed out and was very enjoyable."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Bottle dated June 2014. I had high expectations and this did not disappoint. Somehow, the barrel aging enhanced the flavor of the adjuncts. The barrel character is there, but it is subtle and it blends perfectly with the flavors of the base beer."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","On tap at Abraxas Day 2015.   There is not much wrong with this beer. The head disappears quickly though. But so did the beer, because this is a fantastic brew.  Love the smell and flavor. Cinnamon, chocolate, perfect blend of roast and bourbon with hints of vanilla. Not overly boozy which I appreciate. You can still taste all the flavors of Abraxas, but with the extra goodness from the barrel.  Truly a beer I had wanted to try for a long time, and it was worth the wait."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas",Porty
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","On tap at perennial's 4th anniversary...."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Batch 2, enjoyed along side Abraxas '14, Hunahpu's '15, Double Barrel Hunahpu's, Double Barrel Cake '14"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Rarely does a beer render me nearly speechless. And rarely do I consider giving a beer a perfect score...but this is as close as it gets. Rich chocolate on the nose, with traces of cinnamon spice and oak. On the tongue, all bets are off...this tastes like a cinnamon roll with a bourbon cream cheese frosting. Sticky, lightly charred on the edges and the faintest spiced oak bite. This is hands down the best beer I've tasted all year, and probably top 5 in my life."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Just side by sided B1 and B2. B1 had fallen off and wasn't that good, but B2 was absolutely incredible. A nearly perfect beer. Sex in a bottle. Abraxas with the dial turned up to 12. Loved it. Worth finding at any cost."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Wow! Great smell and tasting of cinnamon, vanilla, barrel, alcohol, chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Sweet and spicy, complex and balanced, great beer!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","L: Pours a deep black with a fingers worth of an almost caramel looking head."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Abraxas is a great beer -- no question about it. The real question here is whether the BA version is worth the trouble. The regular is so big it already drinks a bit like a BA version, so you would be forgiven if you found this barrel treatment a bit ""subtle."" There's some wood added to the complex array of cinammon, chilies, chocolate, etc. already going on, but not too, too much. Still, a nice addition to an already world class beer. You're looking at a 10 percent bump in goodness over the original. That's excellent, but not transcendent. You decide whether it's worth it."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Not as good as hyped. Not too much whiskey, but lots of chocolate and pure cinnamon."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Cinnamon Toast Crunch"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Cinnamon, pepper skin, vanilla, cardamom, and chocolate. Fudge. Cinnamon is the dominant flavor. Barrel integrated extremely well. Oaky, dry, not to sweet. Medium bodied. Pretty awesome beer."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","favorite spiced stout to date, cinnamon more prevalent than the chili, which I prefer, very nice mouthfeel...the alcohol is undetectable...one of the easiest drinking 10+ percent alcohol beers ever"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Very well done!  Smooth all around."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Vintage 2014"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","This was the most Epic beer I have tasted to date!!!  Tons of Barrel and big Cinnamon and it is completely deserving of all the hype!!!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","I was the fortunate one - the one who, after racing to the back left corner at FOBAB 2014, got the fifth-to-last (or so) pour, and they were pouring liberally... to liberally, probably, but that means that I got 4-5 ounces of this amazing brew. I can barely remember it... except that it was awesome."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","bourbon soaked cinimon oatmeal chocolate raison cookies"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","This beer was great but I have to admit, I was slightly let down. It's one of those insanely hyped beers and I suppose it can only let you down. That said, I adore regular Abraxas but the BA version sort of brings out the spice only for me. I wanted more of that beautiful chocolate that regular has. Needless to say it was delicious on draft but would much prefer to try a bottle...then again, swing by the FT:ISO thread and you will realize, so is everyone else in the world."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","The aroma is inviting of aroma, pepper skin, sweet milk chocolate, cinnamon, chunky dark chocolate, fudge."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Smells like a tobacconist's shop. Cocoa is prominent along with chilies. Vanilla like alcohol pressence. Tases like the best bar of chocolate ever. Harmonious blend of the adjuncts with a thick graham cracker backbone. Pleasant spicy finish."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Had a small taste at snallygaster 2014...I literally can t imagine a finer beer."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Finally hunted down this miniature whale of mine at a stout tap takeover at local place The Foundry. Titled ""Big Ass Stout Day"", this is one of the biggest. Six ounces poured into an 8 oz tasting glass."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Talk about cinnamon. This ones like candy and cinnamon all in one. I'd drink it again, but the cinnamon spice was a bit too overwhelming for my personal taste. Regardless an awesome stout. Definitely a good option for a bottle sharing."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Look- Like a black goddess standing on the other side of the bar giving you the look."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Had b2 at almost exactly a year old, wish the peppers had still been there but it was a very good beer. Cinnamon, vanilla, and chocolate still very present, barrel was a bit strong for my liking."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Big stout share. Just didn't like up to the hype for me."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","I could literally smell this wonderfulness 2 ft away from the glass.  Similar to '14 Prop, only more balanced and the ancho pepper puts it over the top.  Best beer I've ever had."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","8 oz. pour for an anniversary part at Bier Station in KC."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Amazing. So good. The bourbon really ties the room together."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","batch 1....can't taste the rare...a nice stout that pushes the cinnamon too far for my tastes and while I really liked the base, something here just didn't do it for me. The lingering heat from either the peppers, the cinnamon, or both, was too pervasive and distracting for me."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Amazing!  Had it on tap at Perennial.  One suggestion I offer is to let it warm up quite a bit.  The cinnamon explodes in your mouth when it's warmer!  It was fantastic!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","A perfect way to describe this is a cinnamon infused, super fresh dark fudge brownie. Awesome deep fudge notes along with a nice cinnamon hint. Not a cinnamon bomb like others in this style have been. Barrel comes through exactly like it should with subtle whisky notes. Everything compliments each other well."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Bottle shared last night by Curran, thanks man."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Thanks to Matt and Kevin, shared with my family on Christmas Eve."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","dropped the review a few points because B2 was significantly less delicious than B1 IMO"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Amazing stout with lots of cinnamon notes, great body"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Awesome and unique beer. I can definitely taste the chili and it makes the beer one of a kind to myself."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Had this from a bottle at FoBAB. Only got 2 ounces, but it was excellent."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","pours black with thin brown head.  Smells of heavy cinnamon and roast.  Smooth taste with chocolate and more cinnamon, minimal heat.  Mouth feel is on the thinner side."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Completely outstanding in every way.  Lucky enough to have had some in June, better than KBS."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","This beer brings barrel aged stouts to the next level. My number 1"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Just about the perfect beer."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Luv This Beer!!!!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","6 oz pour of batch 2."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","On tap at City Beer Store during the event with Perennial.  Beer pours pitch black with thick and creamy dark brown head.  Head dissipates to slick of brown after a few minutes, leaving heavy lacing and alcohol legs.  "
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Worth the trouble to score one."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","from notes, on tap at city beer store. was expecting a shitshow but it was actually business as usual."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","A premier BA spiced stout, equal to Double Barrel Huna as the best two out there.  Fantastic spice & heat, along with great barrel aging to make it a very drinkable beer."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Bottle from trade, 2014 batch with black wax. Pours incredibly black, inky, viscous, and ends up with a finger and a half of dark brown head, creamy looking, too. Incredible aroma of sweet chocolate and cinnamon, spicy rye whiskey, very very faint peppers, vanilla, roasted marshmallows. It's like cinnamon s'mores with whiskey, though the whiskey supports rather than overpowers the smell. Flavor follows with awesome cocoa powder and cinnamon, vanilla whiskey notes, ever so slight spice and warmth that lingers from a combination of the peppers and the alcohol. Thick and viscous, though not syrupy, low carbonation but enough bubbles to keep things thick, and very rich with a slightly roasty dry finish. I was expecting more whiskey on this one, but it melds into the beer so well. Seems very much worth the hype here. Incredible beer, though still takes a back seat to DB Huna for me."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","A - Dark. Caramel tan head that dissipates quickly."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Bottle generously shared by Seth.  Dark brown/black pour with a chocolate head.  Great lacing.  Cinnamon, caramel and fudge blast the old sniffer.  Great body with big fudge, rich caramel, and cinnamon notes that give way to the heat from the ancho chilies.  Wow, a real stunner.  Good carbonation, good balance, great mouthfeel.  It’s simply delicious,what more can I say..."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Picked out by my lovely wife to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary, & that’s about all you need to know about what a fine bride I have. Fifteen years. Damn. 750ML bottle I won in the lottery this year…which I entered once. On a whim. After a drunken tasting. Lucky me!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas",Speechless!
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Got the 2014 version, black wax in a small bottle share. "
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Yet another bottle provided by my favorite trader. Thanks, Dan... Again. Opened at a small share a few weeks ago. This review is from notes. Though, the beer has stuck in my head."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","A-Black in the glass, some carbonation, one finger brown head that dissipates quickly."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Reviewed from notes from 7/24/14"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","2014 release, black waxed. Tulip glass."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","A- Pours as thick as molasses and black as December midnight. Dark brown, rich, chocolatey colored head forms and retains prety well. Looks a little intimidating in the glass. High carbonation for the style is both visibily and audibly evident during the pour."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","This bottle was the 2013 version opened in June 2014. This beer stood out amongst many. It tastes like a rich, fudge brownie with spices and maybe a bourbon glaze. The mouthfeel sets this beer apart. It is as rich as Bourbon County series. The cinnamon and hints of chili are still there to poke through and make this beer interesting. There are hints of vanilla and certainly some booziness. Absolutely decadent and delicious."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Ended up drinking this on my Birthday, bottle provided by Emily from Perennial. I was encouraged to chug the remaining half straight form the bottle which I happily obliged. One of the most spectacular events in my life, one of the most glorious beers ever."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Poured from a 750ml bottle into a specifically labeled Abraxas glass. Thin head quickly dissipated into dark oil-like body. Smell has small traces of whiskey, toasty malt, and heavy cinnamon. No whiskey in the taste at all, but significant cinnamon flavoring. Also coco and toasty malt flavor. Heavy, thick mouthfeel."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","On tap at the Great Taste. I still remember the taste of this beer which I got about 4 ounces of. I honestly should not be doing this as a review but I have to share my thoughts on this beer right now for my own record-keeping purposes."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Had at the weekly 24:1 share. Dang man, this is good. Beer of the year. Smells like coconut, tastes like the nectar that Silenus  would bring to a share w his ole bud Dionysius. Also what stevedore said above. 6!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Poured on draft at the Saison du Fermier release. $10/11-12oz."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Served on draft at bottle pick up day today. Was really excited to try this, just had DB Hunahpu no more than two weeks ago. Poured on draft by Pete into a snifter glass at Perennial. This is Batch 2."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Haven't had the regular version but thanks to rudzud for sharing another big want from my list."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Received in a trade."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Picked this up from a great trade with Mike! Bottled Jan 2013. An aggressive pour yields a beautiful pitch black body with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with basically no lacing. The nose is complex and incredible! The chilies, cacao nibs, and cinnamon are all equally represented, and when you throw in the whiskey barrel, it's over the top! Also getting coconut and vanilla along with hints of dark chocolate and booze. The taste is just as complex. Once again, everything comes through as advertised, which isn't always the case with these types of beers. Huge cinnamon notes, huge cacao, and huge, but not too huge, chili peppers. Tons of dark chocolate fudge and coconut, along with hints of oak, vanilla, whiskey, tobacco, and subtle dark fruits. The mouthfeel is thick and rich and incredibly smooth. The heat from the chilies is there, but it's perfection. Too many times with chili beers, the peppers overwhelm and distract. But not with this beer. Overall, this beer delivers in every way. All the advertised elements were bold, yet equally represented. Can't think of any other beer that delivered on what was advertised quite like this. Highly recommended!"

"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","On tap at the Between the Barrels event at the brewery during StL CBW"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Tap at Churchkey thanks to a secret tip from Travlr and no thanks to twitter, Facebook, or the tap list online. Inky opaque pour. Medium dark coffee head. Nose is cinnamon graham cracker, intense Mexican chocolate with Ancho chili, flashes of American sweet tomato paste bourbon a la fifty fifty eclipse series. Body brings out immediate silky melted dark chocolate, powerful bourbon but no white alcohol or tomato paste. The back end gives tremendous chili heat, cinnamon, dessert spices, bourbon warming. Heating, face flushing back end. Rich, well integrated. This is essentially a redux of Cigar City Hunahpu without the lemon acid and thin tea body. Very delicious and worth the hype. Very thankful to try this thanks to Gene. 4.3 level off the bat. But as it warms, I’m going to equate this experience with the best of Bourbon County Stout bottles I’ve had and make sure it gets the 4.5 it deserves. Incredible. 9/4/9/5/18=4.5"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Got this one from bsuedekum and couldn't wait to dive in. Cheers man! "
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Black as night pour, big dark brown head, but retention was floating. Ended up inky and still. Light bourbon nose, with spice and cinnamon, and slight peppery heat, with roast, char, and chocolate. Tasted heavies on the cinnamon. Light spiciness, medium barrel with touches of booze and a cocoa powder finish. Thick and creamy, full bodied, heavy."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","On tap at Vav's tap takeover at the Norse Bar in Chicago. It was poured into a tulip glass (a generous pour at a reasonable price as well so seek this bar out!)."

"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Reviewing the Barrel-Aged Abraxas from Perennial Artisan Ales out of St. Louis, Missouri. This beer is an imperial stout aged 11 months in Rittehouse rye whiskey barrels with cacao nibs, ancho chiles, vanilla beans, and cinnamon."
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","Served on tap at FoBAB. This was my favorite brew of the day. Appearance is a thick black opaque with oily appearance, a short lived cocoa head present. The aroma is simply amazing. An emphasis of cinnamon, reminiscent of cinnamon toast crunch, with heavy vanilla and bourbon in the background which smooths everything out. Notes of cocoa and chilies are present and add to the complexity of the aroma. The taste is divine. All the flavors are perfectly balanced and smooth. Cocoa comes first followed by cinnamon and vanilla. Some sweetness present with notes of Carmel and brown sugar, but the sweetness comes in harmony with the roasted malts and spices. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very smooth. Overall, this beer is fantastic, the barrel treatment has taken this base beer above and beyond. If you are lucky enough, be sure to try this!!"
"Barrel-Aged Abraxas","On-tap at FoBAB. Warrants a review."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","2016 vintage"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Not sure if I got it from someone who did not keep it well but I would say it's extremely overhyped. Way too smokey which overtook the cinnamon. Tasted like bad crab apples which came from the slight cinnamon and apple brandy."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged",B2
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Delightful. Slight heat, big cinnamon and vanilla. Love the barrel on this. Need more!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","From bottle into Huna chalice."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Review is of b1"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Rating batch 2, because I don't think this beer belongs on the charts where it is. Batch 1 is still phenomenal."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Overwhelmed that day by some other heavy hitters including mead."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Wow the nose of this is just stupid. One of the few double barrel stouts I have had before in which the balance of both barrels work out in unison. Sweet rum plus the complex apple brandy notes bring on a truly unique aroma I have never inhaled before. The taste follows pretty close but not fully. Getting more brandy and rum and much of the apple is lost. Spices coming thru as it warms up. Complex flavors and very rich thick mouth feel. Amazing!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Batch 1 is one of the top 5 beers , drinking amazing right now. Spice has dialed down allowing apple brandy to shine.  b2 needs some time . Little to spicy right now."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Had it a year  ago. Still very delicious. Can only imagine what it tasted like fresh."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","batch 1"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","This pours the classic Huna viscous black with a sliver of stark mahogany around the edges, and a super dark mocha, soft, uniform dense head that dies down sooner than regular Huna, but can also be rejuvenated indefinitely over the entire three hour session the two of us shared this bottle."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Started my Friday with this beer.  The look of this beer was very nice and thick.  Best body I have seen since Morning Delight.  Smell was very nice cinnamon was dominating smell but could get the chili's and cacao on the back end.  The taste was delightful.  Some people told me batch 1 was better I can't even imagine this being better.  It was really delicious, with all the spices and the barrels coming in at once and lasting after the sip.  The taste stays in your mouth. Very nice thick mouth feel where all the chili's, cinnamon, cacao come through."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Batch2 out of a bottle. A little thin, Lots of barrel on the back end.  Couldn't really tell rum or brandy flavors.  Still had some spice and there was a chocolatey flavor still there.  Pretty thin reg. huna mouthfeel.  Good beer, Didn't match the hype of batch 1.  Way better then reg huna though."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Very well balanced and well executed. Each of the flavors comes through very well and the barrels add excellent flavor as well. All the way around, one of the best brews I've had"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Batch 2. Two separate bottles, poured eight hours apart. This beer was a disappointment both times that I had it. "
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Had the 2016 batch.  I loved the heat on this beer. Up front you get the smooth malts and spices and heat on the backside."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Seems the new batch is infected with a tangy off flavor that made this literally undrinkable. Was really excited to try this too."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Thick motor oil, creamy tan head. "
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","this was incredible... had about 8oz from the 2014 batch. Full nose with dark fruits and oaks from the barrel. The taste is incredible- just amazing.. one of the best barrel aged beers ever..."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Smells and looks amazing, mouthfeel is rich and even has legs like a wine. It is unbalanced flavorwise in that it has way to much sweetness. If it were a bit less sweet and more toasty it would be hype worthy."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Pours a thick, jet black with a thin dark brown head. Has an excellent aroma of chocolate and chiles and well balanced by the apple brandy and rum aroma. Tastes just how it smells with a perfect balance of the barrels. Has a nice thick feel that complements the taste. Overall...Amazing."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","L: pours pitch black with a film of very dark head."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Seriously worth the hype. Take the cinnamon and pepper heat of huna and add rum spices and apple brandy sweetness."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","wow, Doc hooked me up with this to celebrate my twin boys. i really wanted this on to celebrate my hero twins haha."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Batch 2 2016. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a cigar city snifter. Opened for my 1st anniversary in Hinesburg, VT. Allowed to warm over a couple hours while drinking it; this review was done about an hour in."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","It's hard for a beer to live up to the high expectations, but this one delivers and then some. How do they combine all these adjuncts and barrel flavors? The cinnamon is bold. The peppers are potent. The vanilla adds sweetness and smooths everything out. The Apple brandy barrel adds fruit. Rum barrels compliment the cinnamon and spice. Mouth feel is intense. This is a dynamic beer, the standard for barrel aged adjunct stouts."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","This is obviously a ridiculously good beer. I had the 2016 batch fresh at the Rare Beer Tasting in Denver last weekend. I loved the beer, but the double barrel aging was a little different this year. I preferred 2015, but this was still really great and bursting with spices."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Fantastic beer!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","B1 rated "
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","4oz From 750ml bottle, not sure of vintage 2014 maybe?"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Holding up well after two years - extremely rich flavor, silky smooth thick mouthfeel. The barrel is very well integrated into the base beer. Would like to try the 2016 vintage fresh!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","This was AMAZING!  Have been saving this one in my cellar.  Batch 1 bottle and I broke it out to share with friends while celebrating a friends birthday and another friends 10 year anniversary....Just the right amount of chili here and the barrel blends of the Rum and Apple Brandy were unreal together!  Lots of chocolate as usual....just downright amazing!"

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Imbibed '14 at a GABF pre party in Colorado from Snifter."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Even after 2 years, this beer remains perfect.  Look is onyx black with no head.  Nose is full of chocolate, cinnamon, apple, and rum barrel.  Taste is out of this world.....cacao, cinnamon, a perfect blend of barrels, and the chiles add flavor but not a lot of heat.  Feel is immaculate....no carbs, medium thick, and zohan silky smooth.  Amazing stout...can't imagine improving on any element."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","This is one of the best beers I've ever had.  Top 3 stout."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Finally had on 7/3/2016. Over 2 years old and apparently hasn't fallen off at all."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","I'm guessing I waited too long to get to this one, but I'm happy to finally open it. I gave my first bottle away a long time ago to @brian29 because I'm just that kind of guy. He told me way back then that it was just OK and said I should probably let him hold my other bottle (Then I saw on here he gave it a 4.9). He cellared it for me in his vast Montresor-like beer cellar. He invited me into the cellar, but fearing my life, I requested he retrieve the bottle himself. Once opened, I found that the barrels are a great addition to the original complex beer. Still a top-notch drink and so smooth and tasty. Drink em if you got em!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","This beer is hands down one of the all-time greats. The execution is perfect from the first whiff to the substantial and lingering flavors on the tongue. There's a lot to praise here from the superbly balanced interplay of the adjuncts to the richly complex barrel treatment. Do anything to get a bottle (or 3)."

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","One of the most pleasurable crafted beers I've tasted"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Poured into  a snifter.  Jet black with no head.  Pours like oil. Smell of cinnamon, chocolate, apple and vanilla dominate. Drinks like syrup. Very think. Cinnamon vanilla and cholate blend seamlessly with the barrels. The base beer is phenomenal and the barrels take it to the next level.  This is truly an elite beer."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","I'm a big fan of the regular version of this beer and the DB version added to the experience.  So much complexity going on in this beer the words are difficult to find.  A definite experience for Huna fans."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","A special and extraordinary beer. Black and viscous, complex, yet mellow....I never got to have it super fresh, but it was still an amazing treat. One of the best mouth feels of any stout I've had...up there with TG stuff."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","The hype is accurate!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","If only they had a 6."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Its so complex, its a bit to much. Didn't think I would ever say that. Before drinking this beer it needs to introduced by something else. Say a regular Hunahpu's  or so."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","L: Dark black body with a minimal sandy/cinnamon colored head and ample lacing"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","A mixture of brown and black patent malts in the appearance, somewhat murky, nothing special here, small 1/5"" tan head.  Aroma was a nice sweet blend of stuff.  I wouldn't say complex, there's just a lot there, chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, rum.  "

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","3,000th review!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","The sweetness to this is really nice.  It certainly had less pepper than the base, which could be lost with age or just overpowered by the excellent sweetness of the apple brandy and rum barrels.  I really enjoyed this one in a very unique way.  Probably won't ever try it again, but certainly knocked off a white whale of mine.  Not oily thich, but not too thin.  Went down very easily with minimal booziness.  Smell and taste were similar where the taste added a lot of complexities.  Caramel, dark chocolate, sweet brandy are at the forefront.  The wood in the barrel shows some nice presence too.  Very nice beer and extremely glad I sought this out aggressively."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","750ml bottle poured into a Portsmouth tulip"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","750ml poured into a matching CCB Hunahpu snifter. The brew appears black in color with a dark mocha head that fades pretty fast and is difficult to revive."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Pour is jet black with a dark mahogany and bubbly head.  Nose is super green at first, burns off after opening up a little, some olive, sugary sweetness, hints of peppery spice, some notes of sweet rum, some dark berry sweetness.  Flavor is so sweet, some chalky chocolate, sweet rum, sugar every where, faint peppery spice in back. Full bodied, nicely carbonated but a touch oily."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Nothing I can add that wont mimic what everyone has said below.  This is a top 5 BA stout anywhere in the world.  The apple brandy is what makes this beer.  Outstanding"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Jet black color with chocolate brown foam head that didn't last very long. Aroma of bourbon, rum, chocolate icing, vanilla. Flavor follows similarly with the right amount of booze. It's not too sweet, the spice is more mild as expected from the base. Very complex. Incredibly smooth. Worth the wait and the hype."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged",Omg
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","So, wow.. This beer is super intense. It pours like thick black ink. Crazy color and viscosity. This is going to be a chore. The smell is very sweet. The residual sweetness imparted from the liquor barrels is really strong in the aroma. Taste is more of the same. Very sweet, but it seems to be battling with the bitterness of the cacao nibs. It's very good, but seems like the flavors are really battling for superiority and no one is winning. Mouthfeel is like drinking a milkshake. It's so thick and sorta slimy. While a really delicious and wildly impressive beer, it was rough for 2 people to finish a 750 ml. This would have been much better if it was shared between 3-4. And it may sound weird, but I wish it was really cold."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Amazed I was able to try this along side it's little buddy (not double barrel aged)"

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Bottle. Poured a black color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy roasted coffee, chocolate, fruit and wood aroma. Heavy toasted chocolate malt and complex alcohol flavor with a heavy dark sweet and small alcohol bite finish of moderate to long duration. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. This is another standout beer."

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","I confidently declare this is the best beer I have ever had. This is the only beer I give 5/5, thus my favorite beer. Bottle to tulip."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","in contrast to regular version, same in appearance except less head.  Nose wafts a bit more vanilla forward, some wood, less of the olive note.   Taste is a bit sweeter with different vanilla altered by a touch more vanilla and cinnamon over chocolate.  The spice comes back a bit stronger with hints of whiskey and wood.  Feel seems a touch less bodied.  Carbonation is a touch more present oddly, but creamy silkiness remains if a touch less."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Wasn't expecting to ever try this one, but there it was. Really dark, almost black pour, with minimal head. May have lost a bit of carb, but not fatal to the beer. The beer smells incredible, with the apple brandy effects really complimenting the cinnamon and spice. Very complex taste, with everything on the bottle present and accounted for. Thick and viscous mouthfeel. Really a great beer."

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Holy shit. Pours very black. Looks great. Swirling it around the glass and it's clinging to the sides. Thick. Most notable flavor is cinnamon, bit of chili pepper skin, and maybe a hint of twang from the AB barrels. I wonder if I'm not getting one particular flavor because everything is so well balanced or not. The Rum and AB barrels just work awesomely with this base. Some warming alcohol presence in chest. Just outstanding."

It tastes like chocolate brownies and bourbon, with a tingle of chilies on the back end. The flavors get even better as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and stays for a long time. Overall this beer is definitely worth the hype."

Possesses an aroma that of a chocolate covered berry that stings the nostrils ever so lightly. The flavor though...well, sends a fusion of chocolate, mild spice, and slight vanilla. Very sweet chocolate overall. Highly recommended for any lover of chocolate stouts. Cheers!"

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Unbelievably dynamic and completely lives up to the hype."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","like no other. the base hunahpu is elite level stuff, truly dynamite, but this double barrel edition is a total game changer, bringing it from magnificent to one of the best beers to ever grace my palate. its everything the base beer is, but the texture, oh god the texture. its like beer jelly, spreadable, but so smooth for how thick it is, coating the palate but not rotting the teeth or guts, it just glides down, really heavenly in feel, unrivaled really, perfect, for real. the taste too is ramped up in this one. its got a hint of calvados in the nose, with that sweet apple fruity cider thing, which is a perfect pair for the dark grain. the rum aspect is a little less obvious, but there is a sweet vanilla spice there which amplifies both the vanilla and the chili peppers. its a genius dual fusion process at work, and it gives further credence to the idea that bourbon barrels are not the ultimate evolution of wood ageing beer. the oak mellows the alcohol that was never even hot in the first place to the level of dangerously easy. it drinks like a cognac though, aromatic and improving always as it warms. again the mouthfeel of this is as good as any beer ive ever sipped. its truly worth the hype, an unforgettable beer and the best i could imagine."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","One of the best BA spiced stout.  This is 1a or 1b with BA Abraxas.  Take normal huna, make it ridiculously smooth and balance everything out, and you have this perfect beer."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Bottle shared by Darkguardian. Joan Jett black pour with a chocolate head. Mild chili and cinnamon aromas. A little thinner in the body than previous treatments I believe, but still fantastic with a beautiful oily sheen. Outstanding with big chili, pronounced cinnamon, vanilla, coconut, and dark roasted malt highlights. Mellow brandy, rum, and oak lowlights. Absolutely fabulous. Excellent mouthfeel."

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Thanks to Paul for picking this up at Cigar CIty from me!  Drinking it on my 52nd birthday.  Incredibly thick, black as night pour with a one finger dark caramel-colored pour that dissipates quickly with almost no lacing.  The nose is somewhat subdued initially, but opened up as it came to temp.  Rich and boozey with huge chocolate fudge notes along with hints of cinnamon, vanilla, soy sauce, dark chocolate, tobacco, and oak.  The taste is bold, complex, and just freaking amazing!  Huge chocolate fudge brownies along with the perfect amount of cinnamon, hints of vanilla, black cherries, toasted coconut, cocoa, espresso, tobacco, and soy sauce.  As it warms, the barrel aging becomes more evident, especially the rum.  Probably the best use of peppers in any beer I've had.  Very subtle, but really adds to the finish and is never overpowering.  The mouthfeel is incredibly thick, but smooth as silk.  None of the featured ingredients are there unecessarily, and all come through in just the right amount.  Overall, definitely the best Imperial Stout I've had, and quite possibly the best beer.  Complex and flavorful without being boozey like the most of the rest in this category.  And at 11%, it's scary drinkable.  Can't recommend this enough!"

The legs on this beer are amazing. Aroma is apple brandy liquer, warm spice cake, thick decadent chocolate, a touch of rum, and some barrel and pepper heat. The taste is just incredible.

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","This is the first time I have taken the time to write any type of review for a beer. It poured into the snifter like motor oil with a thin laced head. It is like eating a spiced chocolate rum cake garnished with toasted coconut and mint and washing it down with whole chocolate milk all at once. Simply amazing."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Maturity, power, grace. Savory, succulent, robust. These are the repetitive words that's going to be used as there are few flavor descriptors that can fully explain this transcendent ale. Its simply in a class all to its own."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","What a great beer! Feel really lucky to have had this one. Appearance is just like reg huna with maybe a little red hue in the light. Smell is apple brandy all the way with a little cinnamon. Taste is amazing...reg huna with Apple brandy mellowed out by the rum (which adds a great sweetness) and close out with a pepper burn. Feel is great, thick but not overwhelming. DBH is just spectacular! Was worried about the rum barrel but it really compliments the beer and makes this the best beer I have ever had!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","This poured with the thickness of a syrup and a pitch black color. The head was like a band of creme that laced in sheets on the edge of the glass."
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Side by side w regular huna. This one doesn't looked as great. Not muh lacing or carbonation present. Smell is different, too. Mostly picking up a sweetness from the barrels. Taste is dominanted with chocolate fudge. I get some spice at the end, with a mix of cinnamon. The apple Brady barrel is what I'm tasting the most, with the other flavors backing a backseat and lingering up on me after. Starting to see the same aftertaste in the base and this, with this one being slightly more sweet. I miss the carbonation in this, but i do like the apple brandy barrels."

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Pours a deep viscous black with glass staining capabilities. The nose presents a plethora of flavors starting with the pairing of apple brandy and cinnamon. This is backed up by strong notes of dark chocolate and vanilla. Amazing nose. The taste is incredibly complex with dark liquid chocolate paired with cinnamon coming first. Fruity apple notes are present along with caramel, vanilla, and oak. Mouthfeel is incredibly thick with mellow carbonation. Overall, a delicious beer. Definitely better than Cali brandy as the barrel seems to harmonize more with the base beer."

Overall it's sweet and spicy but incredibly balanced. Love this beer! Get it and drink it!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Thanks to Kevin for sharing this beer!"
"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","Bottle all to myself because I am a selfish bastard. This one pours pitch black, thick and inky looking, with nothing but a little rim of dark brown bubbles on top until I get a bit more aggressive, then I get a nice small dark brown head on top. Beautiful. Big time sweet cocoa aroma with apple brandy and some rum in the background, a bit of cinnamon, some light chile powder, booze, and some faint vanilla (I don’t get much vanilla in the regular version anyway). Flavor is wow. Big time fudge hits you at the start, with a kick of cinnamon, vanilla, very faint chile burn on the way down. And that’s just the start. There is a nutty flavor from the apple brandy that accents the cocoa and cinnamon perfectly. The rum is subdued, which I am glad about, but adds a subtle extra sweetness and spice, similar to what I got from Forgotten Island. The medley of flavors in this come together almost as well as Founders CBS. This has a thick viscous body as expected from CCB, with low carbonation (but more than Cali Brandy). It goes down incredibly easy relative to Cali as well. The spices really offset the sweetness nicely and make this a pretty amazing offering. To be honest, I came into this expecting some disappointment after Cali Brandy. This is a completely different beer. Wow."

"Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged","On tap in the CCB tasting room, exclusive for El Catador Club members picking up their bottles of Double Barrel Aged Hunahpu"
"King Julius","Pours out cloudy looks like a typical new england style IPA. You can't see through it and its hard to even see light through it. Tastes like the perfect balance between orange juice (minus the tang) and an IPA."
"King Julius","First ever IPA so it was a little bold for an unrefined pallet. Even still it's one of the best I've had."
"King Julius","Canned on 9/2. If I didn't know it was 3 months old, I wouldn't have been able to tell. As long as this beer is refridgerated, this beer holds up well."
"King Julius","Hands down best beer I've had"
"King Julius","Super juicy.  Lots of fruit forward hops and no bite.  Nice medium bodied mouthfeel."
"King Julius","I received this by mail from a generous friend. Even after all abuse it took in transit, still that lucious mouth filling juice bomb. There is an explosion of flavor that brings forward grapefruit and mango and settles into a long lovely finish. Extraordinary!"
"King Julius","Had 2/8/16 at Nate's house out of a growler from the brewery.  It truly is King!  Its exceptional mouthfeel and tropical, (I hate saying) juicy flavor make this one for the ages."
"King Julius","Truly a work of art. This beer is a turbid/opaque orange. Sublime lacing. So tropical in the nose, lots of sweet/chocolate covered oranges on the palate with the creamsicle soft mouthfeel. There is a hop bite after the smooth sweetness up front. I think I prefer Julius to King Julius in terms of drinkability, but they are masterclass brews. Very Hazy is an echelon all on its own though."
"King Julius","So aptly named. There can only be one king of beers and it's not Budweiser but King Julius!"
"King Julius","One of the best Citrusy IPAs I have ever drank. Looked and smelled like a glass of fresh squeezed juice. Best beer of the year for me!"
"King Julius","Poured from a 16oz can dated 9-2-16"
"King Julius","Was really excited to try this. Not at all what I thought it would be. This is the definition of balance. Lots of citrusy sweet fruits and nice malt backbone to round it out."
"King Julius","Had twice from a growler and once from a can on three separate occasions."
"King Julius","Canned Sept. 2, 2016, enjoyed Sept. 27, 2016"
"King Julius","Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 9/2/2016."
"King Julius","Appearance- Dark/burnt golden color with an almost brown hue to it.  Pours a fizzy two finger head."
"King Julius","Super hazy. It looks like orange juice."
"King Julius","I've only had a few of these NE style ipas and was waiting until I had a really highly rated one to weigh in."
"King Julius","Less than 10 days old can into a teku glass."
"King Julius","Poured from the can into a tulip. Hazy orange juice bomb with an elite mouthfeel with really sets it apart from other top notch DIPAs. On par with JJJ/KJJJ."
"King Julius","Here is the thing.  I think this is a great beer.  That being said ..."
"King Julius","Can received in trade with Kevin."
"King Julius","Simply one of the best beers I have ever had bar none."
"King Julius","Pour is a murky tan orange with a bubbly head that retains and laces nicely. Aromas orange zest, mango and peach jump out of the glass. The flavor is jam packed with mango, orange, light citrus and very mild bitterness on the back end, with a light grainy backbone. The mouth feel is thick, lush and smooth, with mild carbonation. The only knock on this beer is that it is not noticeably better than its little brother, Julius. Of course, one of the best things about this beer is that it tastes very similar to its delicious little brother, Julius."
"King Julius","fresh can drank on 9/9/2016"
"King Julius","Strange to have this before regular Julius, but still so happy that I got a can. This truly is, quite simply, the best hoppy beer I have ever had. Didn't think anything could pass the other king (Sue that is), but this is truly phenomenal."
"King Julius","Simply the best beer I've ever had. Huge citrus aromas as soon as I cracked the can, and the taste followed the nose. Mouthfeel was tremendous with this beer. Basically a fruit smoothie. Worth trading for if you can find it."
"King Julius","Imbibed can shipped to Nebraska from Snifter."
"King Julius","First written review here. "
"King Julius","Lucky enough to drink this side by side with fresh Dinner."
"King Julius","Canned 9/2/16. Consumed 9/4/16."
"King Julius","Canned on 02Sep 2016 and enjoyed the same day. Poured into a Duvel Tulip. "
"King Julius","Well, this beer is as close to perfect as I can image. Besides its signature unpolished Tree House look, this beer is as good as it gets. Huge aromas that are beautifully smooth--orange and mango are rounded out by citrus peel. The taste is every bit as good as the smell. It's juicy as $#*% and extremely well balanced, which is mind boggling. The citrusy bitter finish is what really does it. The feel is unparalleled. It's soft and full yet well carbed and not at all boozy. Overall this beer truly lives up to its hype."
"King Julius","Damn this beer is fantastic!! Unreal smell or orange, peach, and mango.  Smooth as can be with loads of citrus up front of course orange heavy.  Oily finish zero malt also just like all treehouse beers. Love it"
"King Julius","Talk about a richness in beer choices from TreeHouse. This is an amazing beer but JJJulius and King JJJulius are a better version of this beer. Looking forward to tasting this beer in the future might be too fresh."
"King Julius","Fresh, 2-day old can, chilled, and poured into a tulip glass."
"King Julius","Pours ultra hazy, orange in color, with 1/3 inch head.  Taste is deep peaches, orange juice, dragon fruit, light melon, and soft doughy bread.  Heavy and full bodied with moderate carbonation. Like Julius but softer and with way more body. This has the best feel of any beer I have had period.   Sweet with a touch of bitterness.  Immaculate.  Well worth the drive and a treat to drink.  This and Very Hazy are two of the best beers I have had period."
"King Julius","It's hype train time!"
"King Julius","A little perspective - I don't live in New England, but still manage to get to Tree House a couple of times a years. Was standing in line a few Friday's ago in Monson when they announced that KJ available in cans -- needless to say, very excited.  From the brewery to my iced cooler to a tulip 90 minutes later -- fully expecting to rant and rave. I am an unapologetic Tree House fan boy and normally find that their big name IPAs/DIPAs live up the hype -- until now.  Don't get me wrong, this is a delicious beer, but best DIPA? #5 overall?  Maybe in #5 among TH beers, but otherwise, I have to think the hype and rarity is driving more than the palate.  Drinking my second can a couple of weeks later before writing the review -- wanted to give this one a second go."
"King Julius","Just had my first taste! Waited in line less than an hour . Treehouse staff is amazingly effective. Got home, popped open a fresh one and man oh man....GREAT beer!"
"King Julius","Great beer I was able to enjoy at a tap takeover a while back ( makeup review )                        "
"King Julius",Amazing.
"King Julius","See the review of Julius, now take that on turbo mode... Honestly though, I would take Julius over this in a blind taste test.  King J is a special treat, for sure, but the extra everything pushes this into the category of over the top.  Very Green and Very Hazy do a much better job at pushing the limits while adding something special to the base beers.  King J has the hype for sure, I mean, come on, you take perhaps the best IPA in the world, Julius, and put ""King"" in front of it?  Craziness on all fronts.  Still, and exceptional Treehouse offering, surprise surprise."
"King Julius","This is one of only maybe 4-5 beers I've had that I would give an absolute perfect score. I was very lucky to have this as my very first Treehouse Beer when I wandered to Monson MA one fateful day to see what the brewery was all about, and it happened to be a King Julius release."
"King Julius","Quite possibly the perfect beer. Tremendous aroma and easy to drink. If you are a hop head this is the beer for you!"
"King Julius","Everything about this beer screams DELICIOUS! "
"King Julius","Had at Huna Day on a share.  Was slightly old but would have expected it to hold up better for being a double.  I also fully acknowledge I am a TG fanboy.  I had alongside Julius, Todd the Axeman and Pseudo Sue.  Thought regular Julius was way better but would but Todd the Axeman above all of them."
"King Julius","Probably best new imperial IPA i have had in a long time. better than HAZE"
"King Julius",Amazing!
"King Julius","Best Double IPA I've had the opportunity to try. Super juicy, so easy to drink. Absolutely worth the hype that it gets. Hope to get a ton more of this in the future"
"King Julius","Truly fit for a King. A creamy tropical smoothie, incredibly soft on the pallet. Insanely juicy and thirst quenching, all hail King Julius! Tree house can do no wrong"
"King Julius","Never thought I'd be doing this. Pours out haze4daze. Can't see a thing through it. Looks like orange juice. Smells like a fruit smoothie with orange, pineapple, peaches and other passion fruits. Taste is an explosive melange of smooth fruits. No way this is beer. So smooth and creamy. The best dipa and probably the best hoppy beer ever invented."
"King Julius","Poured a hazy juicy looking peach orange from the can. The nose didn't punch me in the face like Julius did but it still smells fantastic with citrus and tropical fruit aroma. The mouth feel was soft and it tasted so juicy with a very fleeting rind bitterness that just made this an excellent IPA."
"King Julius","This just missed the mark for me.  Still a nice beer, but I think the subtle juicyness and upping the hop & malt bill don't quite mix.  The nose and taste add a distinctive vegetal flavor to the typical Julius ""straight juice homey"".  I'll stick to the regular Julius for now."
"King Julius","Good, but not amazing. Too much of a good thing maybe?"
"King Julius","Can pours golden orange with great haze, juicy orange nose, amazingly smooth fruit, hops, juice blend. Great hop flavor with no bitterness whatsoever. As a huge fan of Julius, this was everything I had hoped for..."
"King Julius","Julius on steroids.  simply amazing beer."
"King Julius","Hail to the King!"
"King Julius","Very good, lots of citrus in this beer, but not as balanced as Julius. Orange and tangerine came to mind, with a hint of grapefruit. Also some tropical fruit, mango and peach. The alcohol was present too. Overall very good beer, but not as good as I'd hoped."
"King Julius","L- Golden Orange, a nice amount of white head on the pour, fairly hazy"
"King Julius","exceptional beer. have had it a few times now and is a total juice bomb. i love it but very green was better."
"King Julius","Sample at EBF 2016"
"King Julius","Wow! Poured from can into pint glass.. Sweet bouquet of fruits, hops and other residuals. Murky orange color with a solid white head that did not die. Well balanced and not as hoppy as I expected for a DIPA. Flavors rest well on the palate with moderate bitterness. Another outstanding beer by those at Treehouse!!"
"King Julius","Had King Julius and Julius side by side, both fantastic beers, wish I had an endless supply of both."
"King Julius","""It's good to be king"" is what's printed on the bottom of the can, and no that's not much of an exaggeration.  I will admit my first few sips didn't wow me as much as I expected them to, but as I got further into it the orange juice started to flow more and more across my taste buds. I won't say it blew me away as much as the standard Julius did last year, if only because I knew what I was getting myself into this time.  But that doesn't mean that this isn't a world class DIPA that is worth tracking down.  King Julius might be bit overrated (given how it skyrocketed into the top 10, that's almost impossible not to say), but it's definitely worthy of Tree House's top 3 IPAs."
"King Julius","Pre-Doppelganger, a heavyweight bout of some Tree House big boys."
"King Julius","Best DIPA out there? Between this and Dinner imo."
"King Julius","Had this at least 10 times, both out of the can and out of the growler, no more than a week old. No other beer I've had has made me burp up more hop flavor than KJ. Everything you love about Dr. J, but turned up to 11. Juicy beyond juicy, great out of the can or in a glass. A true treat. Trade whatever you can to get some of this fresh!"
"King Julius","A: Pours a kind of ugly turbid brownish copper color with a nice, fluffy off-white head. Definitely not a looker, but neither are a lot of great beers. We move on."
"King Julius","King Julius was the top hoppy beer for me at EBF. Everything I love about Julius, but taken up another notch. So juicy and so balanced for a double IPA. Tremendous."
"King Julius","Anyone who has had Julius will know what they are in for with this one. Great pulpy, juicy flavor that is like a fresh squeezed glass of OJ. Pretty similar to the original, which I preferred a tad more (along with Curiosity 22). Both seemed to have a little better nose and brighter tropical flavors. Still, this is really great."
"King Julius","Poured from a pint can into tulip glasses, purchased 1/29/16:"
"King Julius","Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
"King Julius","Everything it's cracked up to be. Treehouse can do no wrong. Unicorns, show ponies , where's the beef! Amazing awesome fantastic, so good. Just trying to get to 150 characters."
"King Julius","This was my first time trying any treehouse brew. I acquired a few of these in a trade, and I am blown away. The color is something ive never seen before, a hazy orange juice look. The aroma about knocked me out, and after tasting it... I'd be happy if this was the only brew I could drink for the rest of my life. Wow. This is the only time Ive given a perfect 5, and as hard as it is for me to do, this certainly deserves it."
"King Julius","Opened a week after canning. After opening the can the room was immediately filled with big hop and fruit aromas. In the glass this smells like a giant glass of orange juice with every delicious juicy fruit mixed in. Just an amazing smell. This beer tastes like it smells, a wonderful juicy bomb of citrus and hoppiness. Minimal bitterness and a well balanced profile make the 8% alcohol in this beer dangerously hard to find. This is truly one of the best IPAs I have ever had. In my mind tied with King Sue and DDH Fort Point Pale Ale. Well worth what it takes to get this beer."
"King Julius","bought from brewery 1/30/16 and drank next day"
"King Julius","This is the best IPA / Double IPA I have ever had.  It is somehow juicier than Julius and no boozy taste.  It smells great and is absolutely delicious.  I did a blind taste test with Julius, In Perptuity, and Alter Ego and this easily was the best out of the four beers.  Hope to come across this one more often, hopefully Treehouse makes this one a regular."
"King Julius","I've been looking forward to this one forever. 750ml growler into a Grrrz teku. Shared with schen9303. "
"King Julius","750 ml. growler filled yesterday."
"King Julius",Perfect
"King Julius","From growler. Burnt orange, orange juice. Multi finger froth head. Quick dissipation but a layer keeps as it goes down. Elite lacing. To steal my friend's description of the smell, it smells like the brewery. Well vice versa. Hint of malt with saturated hops with a fruit juiciness. A good bitterness element. Juice flavor shines. Anything and everything in that orange and grapefruit family. Like Charles Barkley gave them his Orange Bowl ""oranges"". Feels like carbonated juice. Like a shake/float but without anything that would be gross in an ipa. King indeed."
"King Julius","Pours a very hazy burnt orange color with a thick creamy, pillowy head on that lingers nicely throughout. Thick, sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is orange, mango, bright tropical. Flavors reflect the same, very nice bitter flavor to balance with the sweetness of the tropical, mango, orange flavors. Drinks extremely smooth, like a tropical smoothie. Long live the King!"
"King Julius","Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery yesterday. "
"King Julius","L: Typical treehouse look, bright orange hazy beer, burnt orange in the center.  Frothy white head and a bit of lacing."
"King Julius","Canned on 12/3"
"King Julius","Pours an entirely clouded pineapple juice colored beer, with a one finger broad, bubbly head."
"King Julius","Although it is only produced a couple times a year. I was fortunate enough to get some to bring home.  Absolutely delicious.  Citrus flavor with a DIPA kick."
"King Julius","Came to this with very high expectations. Looks fantastic in the glass like all Tree House IPAs. Aroma might be the best I've ever experienced from an IPA. Oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, papayas, and mangoes explode from the glass. The aroma is pungent. This fruit explosion doesn't follow through on the taste for me. There is a sweetness from the malt and the larger mouth feel makes it a little sticky, sappy, and resinous. This is nice, but it took away from the fruit somewhat. Fantastic beer. My criticism is only based on the expectation of 5.0. Definitely trade for this."
"King Julius","KJ 16 oz can poured into a TH snifter. A hazy-orange color when poured into the glass. Had a good amount of carbonation with decent amount of head. The smell was amazing! Aromas of citrus, orange, tropical fruit, and small amount of funk. The taste, well... yeah... this one was delicious! One of the fruitiest offerings from TH outside of Juice Machine and a few others. The beer is extremely smooth, creamy and juicy with a nice hop finish to it. This if by far one of my favorite DIPAs to date! Definitely try to get your hands on a can (or more) if possible! Cheers!"
"King Julius","Appearance - Hazy. Almost opaque like orange juice. Thin head that dissipates quickly."
"King Julius","16oz can poured into a Treehouse Teku glass - Thanks Leo!"
"King Julius","i could not get enough"
"King Julius","Shared side by side with a Julius."
"King Julius","This beer tastes like a grownup ""Julius"". More of a sophisticate taste with lots of juicy fruits and a grand finish to make you want to finish the whole bottle in one sitting."
"King Julius","Amazing nose. Beautiful cloudy look like all Tree House offerings. A one of a kind. Have it with seafood and be blown away."
"King Julius","I thought Julius couldn't get any better, I was wrong. This beer did not disappoint. As soon as you crack the can you can tell how awesome it is. The tropical explosion starts with the aroma and stays all the way to the end with mango standing out above all the flavors to me. Amazing beer."
"King Julius","Next to Dinner, this is the best double IPA ever!"
"King Julius","Was lucky enough to be able to trade away for a fresh can of the king… Poured a deep orange with a cloudy bottom kind of like a Mimosa.   lots of citrus nose on this bad boy followed by a face full of grapefruit and citrusy hops !!  I hope they continue to make this one on a regular basis because I will seek i I hope they continue to make this one on a regular basis because I will seek It out!!"
"King Julius","Re review and rating.  Had this on 9-10-16 from a 9-2-16 canning.  Pours a turbid light yellow.  Smells and tastes on par with orange juice that has been robbed of any sugar.  Most impressive in my opinion was that I did not detect any bitterness in the finish."
"King Julius","Got cans and a growler from brewery. "
"King Julius","Pours a thick cloudy orange color. Has a huge citrus tropical fruit aroma. Flavor is delicious. Tropical fruit of papaya and mango with juicy citrus. Super smooth finish. Overall this is a great beer"
"King Julius","Everything about this beer is so tree house, and so delicous. Its so similar to Julius but with more tropical punch and more alcohol, but just as smooth as anything they make. yummy."
"King Julius","Look - The resemblance between this and straight orange juice is insane. The ideal look in my opinion. "
"King Julius","Bottom line up front, this is an amazing beer. "
"King Julius","Pours a hazy yellow cloudy with a 1 inch head. Smells like an IPA with lots of orange juice and magi juice in it. Smooth juicy up front taste followed by nice bitter finish. Has a nice smooth mouthfeel."
"King Julius","Cloudy dull orange in color, smell is ripe citrus, and taste follows, very juicy and orange orange with nice moderate hop finish. Juicier than Julius, not as creamy but still incredible."
"King Julius","Having now had this a couple times in a week since its rerelease, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the perfect beer regardless of classification. Here's the thing it's not the first 5 that I've given out, and no doubt because Julius is perfect to me, I simply had to grade this the same- and normally when we compare beers that are a 97 vs a 98 there's just subtle nuances that distinguish them. This is the same only Julius is a 100, this is a 103- soft, citrus explosion w tremendous mouth feel and hop profile... seek w confidence, I suspect it'll be out more soon, but if you gotta friend, hit him up!"
"King Julius","The appearance of this beautiful! Turbid, but cautious as not to appear ""murky"". Bright apricot/orange hue, just like the TH in the label. Stunner. #Hazefordaze"
"King Julius","The beer comes in a medium gold color, extremely turbid. Mango smoothie color in a glass."
"King Julius","16 oz. can.  Hazy deep orange.  Darker at the bottom of the pour, like peach juice where the pulp settles to the bottom.  Smell is tropical fruits.  Mango, orange.  Some sweetness.  Tastes tropical as well, with more emphasis on the orange flavor.  Light sugary sweetness up front.  Dries out and becomes a touch bitter in the finish.  Medium body.  Exactly as described.  A bigger version of Julius.  Drank a Julius before drinking this for science.  It would be impossible to ramp up the hop flavor by the same order of magnitude that the sugars are amplified.  By that metric, I think I would take Julius over this."
"King Julius","16 oz can.  Pours cloudy apricot-orange with thick white head that fades to a thin layer, coating lace.  The aroma is sooooo juicy, orange and peach and plum.  Taste is about as juicy as it gets, wow! Near perfect balance of sweet fruit and dank citrus rind bitterness.  Nice dry finish with the hops hanging around just right. Very little alcohol presence.  Soft full mouthfeel.  Incredible brew, possibly the best IPA so far. My favorite trader hooked me up with this one, thanks bro!"
"King Julius","Can. Poured super hazy orange. I had this side-by-side to regular Julius. I was impressed by how the similarities still stood tall between the two beers. Very citrusy and fruity and rindy. There were also some big contrasts. King Julius was clearly more pungent and concentrated; losing some of Julius' nuances. Still, by the nose, I should enjoy this beer similarly (Julius is one of my favorites). The flavor was huge on tropical fruit and citrus medley. Some dank character. Tangerine, melon, clementine, citrus pith. A powerful mollywhop of flavor. The body was creamy. Pretty sturdy bitterness but not an IBU baron. I really enjoyed this one; I mean Tree House does no wrong. However, I think if this beer had a moniker not directly related to their flagship, this one would not be held in quite the same regard. Pretty amazing but I'll take regular Julius any day."
"King Julius","This beer looks perfect poured out.. completely opaque and just bright orange color. if you smelled this not knowing you would not think its beer.. its like fresh squeezed citrus juice.. that taste is amazing... its too smooth for 8.2% you could drink these all night because it is so good and so smooth..  mouthfeel is perfect... I would not change anything about this beer except for me having more!"
"King Julius","Pours a golden hazey Orange in the glass.  Small bit of head but powerful aroma of orange.  Similar to Julius but smoother.  The alcohol is not noticeable at all.  Really great beer. Just wish I had more than one."
"King Julius","Cloud orange color, like regular julius.  The nose is a citrus and mildly sweet hop.  The taste follows with a lot of orange and smooth sweet bitterness.  Feel is very full and enjoyable.  A very good beer."
"King Julius","L: Cloudy golden hues with minimal lacing and thin layer of foam"
"King Julius","An IPA/IIPA just doesn't get much better than this. An amazingly smooth mouthfeel with no bitterness on the backend. The 'orange creamsicle' taste that they describe is just about on point. It's juicy/tropical/hoppy goodness all in one. I think this beer will ruin most other ipas for me. I didn't get as much on the nose as others, but smelled great from what I got."
"King Julius","Julius on steroids.  A little light on the head, but awesome aroma and very Julius-like taste.  Alcohol is incredibly well-hidden.  This was delicious.  I regret that I only have 4 ( now 3).  Awesome beer!"
"King Julius","I have to echo the sentiments of the masses on this beer.  This is so blatantly Julius.  Drank them back-to-back and they are almost entirely similar.  The one-off differences are probably the smoothness of this beer and it's slightly sweeter.  Presumably due to the higher ABV and dry hopping?  Regardless King Julius is a top-notch IPA through and through.  My only (small) critique is that there really isn't much in this beer that's different from Julius.  Maybe that's a good thing, but it makes it a little less special since Julius is so readily available at the brewery these days.  Still... a must-try for any and all Tree House fans and IPA fans."
"King Julius","It's definitely Julius.  All the juicy flavors and creamy mouthfeel are there.  A little bit of bitterness creeps in at the end of each sip.  I wish I had a fresh Julius to compare it to but they are honest very similar brews which is not a bad thing at all!"
"King Julius","Everything that's great about the delicious orange and tropical fruit flavored of Julius, only intensified with a tidal wave of extra hoppiness.  A marvelous, world-class DIPA.  On par with the  best ive ever tasted in the category."
"King Julius","Another fantastic beer from Tree House. Which isn't shocking. Its Julius on roids. Wish I got more.I was lucky enough to have a buddy give me a can. Anytime they brew this you must check it out. I enjoyed every sip,and almost cried when it was gone. Then I drank some GREEN and felt better."
"King Julius","L - Orange sunburst is the best way I can describe this. Held it up to the light and it lit up the opaque orange liquid. Cannot see through this beer. "
"King Julius","I love Julius.  Prob my fav IPA at the moment,  living within 30 minutes of the brewery I had opportunity to get my hands on the super rare King Julius.  "
"King Julius","Poured from a can into #ProperGlassware"
"King Julius","Tasted in Tulip glass poured from a 16 oz can.  I know TH beers are intended to be had super fresh, but I tend to like the cans with a little time on them to allow the contents to acclimate to its environment - for this beer the anticipation was too great."
"King Julius","Pours bright orange, hazy and opaque. Smells of sweet orange and citrus hops. Taste follows the smell. This beer is incredibly hoppy and flavorful, with just enough bitter finish to make you go back for another sip, again and again. Incredible soft carbonation. A top, top beer."
"King Julius","Doing a side-by-side comparison with Julius. "
"King Julius","L: super hazy/turbid.  Looks like a glass of OJ.  Nice orange glow with a solid white head"
"King Julius","Plain and simple. This stuff is phenomenal"
"King Julius","picked up some treehouse after work.  appearance is hazy orange 2 finger size head that dissipates quickly.  aroma is heavy on orange and some mango.  Taste follows the nose, explosion of orange with some mango and other tropical fruits but orange dominates the mouth.  incredible beer but the domination of orange is what holds it back from the likes of double sunshine and other top IPA's imo."
"King Julius","Poured this one in a snifter side-by-side with regular Julius.  I know they aren't the same, but I wanted the comparison.  The best way I can describe the difference is that the King is loaded with flavor and aroma. So if you have had Julius, try to imagine that (one of which that is already aromatic and flavorful) amped to the next level. Upon cracking open the can, I immediately was bombarded with tropical notes.  The flavor is complex, but melon is the dominant feature.  An awesome beer that only comes out a few times a year, this is worthy of trading for."
"King Julius","It looks nothing like the last version.  Looks like a murkier Julius.  Tastes like a triple dry hopped Julius with a little alcohol bite. Super juicy."
"King Julius","Smells of citrus orange danky goodness. Looks as such. It pours juicy, thick and cloudy. Mouthfeel is excellent with light body. It's incredibly smooth for DIPA. Be careful drinking this one."
"King Julius","long wait for the elusive King. Same look and feel as Julius, smell is slightly hoppier with a citra sting, and the taste is marvelous. Tangerines, mixed with a pineapple follow up. The alcohol hits the back fo the throat just as the pineapple washes it away. Delicious"
"King Julius","Growler was old but I could still get a sense of what it would be like.  Prefer normal Julius."
"King Julius","Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes."
"King Julius","Tried once...then a 2nd...now a third.  With out a doubt this is a great dbl ipa.  I would take jr over this in a heart beat.  However, this brew creeps on you more."
"King Julius","Very happy to have gotten a chance to try this, but I have to say I think I prefer standard Julius by a hair."
"King Julius","Fresh growler poured into Pilsner glass."
"King Julius","This might have been the most disappointing beer I have had to date from Tree House, since in my mind I was imagining a DIPA that would equate to an even better version of Julius. "
"King Julius","From notes, drank it yesterday.  750ml bottle about 8 days olds."
"King Julius","I have been fortunate enough to have King Julius on a couple of occasions in growlers and cans. This happens to be my favorite beer that I have had to date."
"King Julius","On tap at dive bar.  Killer DIPA."
"King Julius","Really incredible, and really a 5.  I can find no fault!"
"King Julius","Picked up on 4/25, tasted on 4/3"
"King Julius","AMAZEBALLS! AMAZEBALLS! AMAZEBALLS! Did I say AMAZEBALLS? More cinnamon than I had anticipated..."
"King Julius","750ml bottle poured into a globe."
"King Julius","750 mL growler from brewery. Amazing."
"King Julius","What can I say? This beer is phenomenal, a boosted version of Julius. You can smell from the glass a distance away. Cloudy Golden orange color. Smells like fresh citrusy hops bursting out with a matching taste. Perfect smooth mouth feel allows for easy drinkability. All Hail King Julius"
"King Julius","This beer sets the bar for DIPAs. This is what to expect from the future. L- cloudy, hazy orange, seemingly similar to the pithy dankness of orange juice. S- the smell of oranges, orange dreamsicle and rind over take the nose like whirlwind and bit with overbearing fruitness. Citrus. Juice. Orange. And maybe a hint of mango. T- i've had orange juice that was boozier than this.  Crushing the game with pure orange. Juice citrus. As if i had just freshly squeezed orange juice.  This beer kills me. F- as usually, Tree Houses signature pillowy mouthfeel overwhelms and gives you a full blown mouth orgasm. True to beer beer form. If there was a better beer, please lead me the way. Otherwise, shut up and let me enjoy this perfect brew."
"King Julius","Beaten by JLindros. Been a loooong time for that. Seeing his review I am even more excited to try this beer. "
"King Julius","Pours into my Hill farmstead stem tulip with a nice creamy but lighter head that hits about 1/2 finger, with some decent sticky lacing... as you mentioned Nate, the lacing on the glass right off the tap was much nicer, but that doesn't stop the awesomness of the beer itself from shining through. Speaking of shining, the beer is not shiny at all, a murky hazy tangerine slightly coppery colored beer."
"Very Hazy","Acquired in trade, less than10 days old and shared with 4 other people as part of an IPA tasting."
"Very Hazy","Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with thick white head. Aroma is tropical fruits with some grapefruit. Extremely well balanced. Excellent tasting that goes down way too easy. Huge tropical fruit flavor with mango, papaya, pineapple and also some tangerine. Incredible imperial IPA."
"Very Hazy",Fantastic
"Very Hazy","All around amazing. One of the best in the world imo.  Perfect balance of bitterness and flavor."
"Very Hazy","This is the king of NE IPAs in my opinion. Hazy, light orange appearance and bursting with fruit flavor. I get grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit, and tangerines. Nice mix of citrus and tropical. Full mouth feel, and just the right balance of sweet and bitter. This is worth trading for."
"Very Hazy","For the hype...meh"
"Very Hazy","Just another outstanding beer from Treehouse.  Full of citrus - juicy goodness. Smooth and easy to drink - no boozyness at all.  Bursting with flavor.  Not easy to get but worth the effort."
"Very Hazy","Holy shit!!!!"
"Very Hazy","Reviewed on 4/10/17"
"Very Hazy","Without question, one of the best beers I've ever had.  Full smooth mouthfeel beyond compare; pours beautifully within a very hazy orange spectrum and mellows nicely after opening; a perfect mix of sweet fruits and bitterness that kept me coming back for more.  Limited offerings make this a fanatical must have.  The DIPA world has met its match !"
"Very Hazy","Thank you to Drew for making the dream of VH a reality! Incredible stonefruit profile with beautiful resinous nose and decadent mouthfeel. Phenomenal."
"Very Hazy","What more could I possibly add to make people know that this beer is a must try/bucket list beer? Pours, well, hazy. Smells like something you should be enjoying on a tropical beach. As far the taste, you already know it's as close to perfect as you can get. Typical soft and juicy mouth feel that you'd expect from Tree House.  "
"Very Hazy","Canned 3/23/17; drank 4/3/17 @ the Yarchives. "
"Very Hazy","Favorite Tree House to date."
"Very Hazy","Most drinkable DIPA I've ever had.  cloudy and citrusy hops like swish but the drinkability of ALL Day IPA.  This is ridiculously good. Hides the heat better than any beer I've ever had"
"Very Hazy","Canned a week and a half ago.  Tulip glass."
"Very Hazy","This is absolutely excellent. It holds all of the characteristics that make Tree House great. This is hazy, super aromatic, love that bubblegum taste from TH, flavorful, packs a punch without overpowering. Delicious!"
"Very Hazy","I feel blessed that there were surprise cans (two) at the end of the line to go with the daily offering. Pours thick into a deep, cloudy orange, with almost a little grey to it – like orange fog. The head dies down quickly leaving tight lacing along the sides. Very small bubbles of carbonation. Solid hop foundation with layers of subtle top notes – they reveal themselves as they moves around my tongue. Mango and orange highs, with some notes of grass, hay, and earth, with some rising bread dough mixed in – yet none of these flavors dominates. So soft and smooth – even with the higher abv there's only a little alcohol bite. This one really makes me slow down and savor it as it deserves."
"Very Hazy","Treehouse V Hazy, thanks for the share Josh."
"Very Hazy","Canned 3/23/17."
"Very Hazy","A 16 oz can poured into a Tree House teku. The date was smudged but it looks like 3-23-17. "
"Very Hazy","This is treehouse's best beer. The look of this beer was like straight up peach/orange juice. Smell was of peaches,mango, pineapple. The taste and mouthfeel were exceptional. It's like drinking a thick pillowy cloud of peaches, oranges, mango, pineapple. This improves an already great beer in Haze. Amazing"
"Very Hazy","I like regular Haze but it isn't amongst my favorite TH beers so I didn't expect this version to completely blow my mind. But it did. "
"Very Hazy","Poured into a TH tulip at BTs Smokehouse about 15 minutes after picking up at the brewery.  Very Hazy is aptly named, about a finger and a half of big bubbles in the head and beautiful lacing.  Aside from the bubbles, looks like orange juice in the glass.  Smells like tropical fruit and citrus....quite strongly.  Tastes incredible, very hop forward citrusy and tropical.  Its balanced with a slight biterness on the back end, no alcohol tasted in this at all....very dangerous at 8.6%, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Another wonderful offering from the best brewery I've had the pleasure of visiting."
"Very Hazy","I like haze. Its one of the better treehouse beers. I expected to LOVE this beer but came away thinking it was kind of meh. It has a peachy nose and some peach/ pasonfruit vibes but doesn't do it for me. It also doesn't feel as creamy as it should. Flavour isn't there. Honestly, I'd skip this one."
"Very Hazy","This beer made me fall in love with Treehouse.  It ruined any beer that wasn't Treehouse to just be ehh."
"Very Hazy","Look: orange sherbert, 1inch creamy white head... light orangish yellow, really gorgeous "
"Very Hazy","hazy as it is named. Mango, pineapple, glorious fruit bomb with the distinguished soft fluffy feel of all TH brews. Glass lacing from top to bottom. These people nail it every time. Great job again Nate"
"Very Hazy","Canned 02-18-16. Drank 02-20-16. Juicy, creamy & wonderful. No sign of abv. Fantastic IIPA."
"Very Hazy","Favorite double IPA in the world"
"Very Hazy","This is the best beer I've ever had.  Absolute perfection.  Since we're all incredible beer snobs now, we can still find something to nitpick about a a King Julius or a Very Green, but not this one.  It is simply perfect.  Mango, pineapple, Guava, dank, turbidity, pillowy, hazy, whatever.  Incredible."
"Very Hazy","The best of Tree House's offerings.  Even after about 6 weeks it was better than anytjing else fresh."
"Very Hazy","Can poured into tulip."
"Very Hazy","A: Full yellow haze, white head."
"Very Hazy","This might just be the greatest beer that Tree House has ever had and that I have every tasted. This beer is perfectly named with a truly opaque murkiness. Incredible head/lacing, a bouquet tropical aromatics that smells like fresh blended juices. I get a lot of guava, papaya, passionfruit, and pineapple. There is a ever so slight hop/bitterness note towards the end that sparks and sizzles. There are so many layers of complexity that it is rather difficult to capture solely with words. Drink fresh. Cheers to the many blessings Tree House has bestowed upon me."
"Very Hazy","What can I say -  Its Tree House for god sake."
"Very Hazy","Very hazy (hurr), very little head. Fresh, tropical smell. Feels thick, almost. Almost no alcohol taste (some at the end), sweet fruits, mostly tropical pineapple and mango, slightly resinous."
"Very Hazy","Huge thank you to Mark for sharing this treat."
"Very Hazy","Poured from a 16oz can dated 6-20-16"
"Very Hazy","I love Haze and Very Hazy just pushes the limit on everything wonderful about it. Awesome strong peach nose, classic Tree House mouth feel, and no sense of the alcohol for an 8+% beer. Wonderful"
"Very Hazy","750 ml swing top poured into rocks glass."
"Very Hazy","Absolutely incredible. No booze presence. Beautiful combination of grapefruit and tropical notes. Mouthfeel is perfect. Not too sweet, soft carbonation. Great juicy aroma. Easily one of the best beers I have ever had"
"Very Hazy","Easily the best beer from TreeHouse. Its just delicious, every time i drink this beer, i cant wait for the next sip of hoppy sweetness bitter creamy goodness."
"Very Hazy","OK, so I am a big time Tree House fan boy  even if I have to cross the Madon-Dixon and can only get their wares a few times a year. This is another epic offering. Unfiltered , cloudy; huge tropical nose that doesn't disappear. Flavors  - this one has an incredible balanced mix of tropical flavors and grapefruit bitterness. And of course, the super soft Tree House mouthfeel brings it home. Perfect carbonation. Ever so slight hint of the 8.6 at the very end, but hardly noticeable. Mad props again to lunchboxhead for his more than generous trade that included this gem. In my opinion this one stands among the very best of the TH giants. If buying into the Monson hype is wrong, then I don't want to be right."
"Very Hazy","Another excellent one from TH. Hazy, murky tan-yellow color. Booming juice on the palate, however, it was a bit more bitter and astringent than I would have liked. Prefer plain ole' TH Haze."
"Very Hazy","Canned 8/19/16. Consumed 8/26/16."
"Very Hazy","Pours super hazy, bright orange-yellow in color, with one inch head.  Even by Tree House's high standards, this looks amazing.  Taste is sweet peach, nectarine, and orange.  Like regular Haze, my previous favorite Tree House brew, but with extra fruit flavor.  Heavy bodied, thick, slight bitterness and lots of goodness.  May be my favorite Tree House brew.  Well worth driving out for.  Only my third perfect beer in 2,500 ratings.  Cannot see how an imperial IPA can taste any better, but am willing to search for that brew."
"Very Hazy","Canned and enjoyed on 19Aug 2016"
"Very Hazy","This poured out as a hazy golden color with a thick white head on top. The smell is loaded with hoppy aromas. The taste is balanced between the sweet malt and some big powerful hops. Overall this beer is very good."
"Very Hazy","Not the pineapple/guava type flavor as their flagship beer, but way better. It has tropical notes, but a nice malt and bitterness to balance it out. If you get a chance to try it, do so. Tulip glass, and not fridge temps."
"Very Hazy","Perfect Very Hazy look, no doubt, it's glorious. Small is on point, doesn't pop to perfection but it smells soft and mellow, tons of tropics and onion.... bring it on i love where this stands so far... Taste is fucking insane I swear to god that they added sugared grapefruit extract to this. This might be... i can't say it... i won't but its one of the very best from treehouse, they perfected the mouthfeel for 8.6% there is virtually no alcohol presence at all, it is incredible. Sharp and quick (?) finish, this beer is special and I am forever envious of anyone that lives near this brewery."
"Very Hazy","Consumed from the can. Reviewed from notes."
"Very Hazy","The beer comes in a medium gold hazy color."
"Very Hazy","Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse snifter. Thank you Patrick for hooking me up with this, been seeking a can out for a while. "
"Very Hazy","No one is doing hoppy beers like Treehouse at the moment and this is just more proof. I tend to prefer the regular iterations of these beers to their ""double"" or ""very"" cousins, but this one came closest to the original for me."
"Very Hazy","Amped up haze. My second favorite tree house ipa behind very green. Amazing beer"
"Very Hazy","Amazing complexity and depth yet so crushable.  Unreal beer."
"Very Hazy","Wow!  What a phenomenal beer.  This is worth a wait in line, worth trading for, worth seeking out!  I have nothing more to say.  I'm going to savor the rest of this 750.  Wow!"
"Very Hazy","6/2/16 can drank in my lovely Tree House chalice"
"Very Hazy","Creamy, fruity, nice hop balance.  One of the best beers I've ever had"
"Very Hazy","This is almost perfect for me.  Words can't describe how good this beer truly is.  For an 8.6% this beer is dangerously drinkable.  The crazy part is I wasn't a real big Haze guy to begin with because of the first batches that, let's be honest here, were bad batches but once they got it right ... my god is any Haze growing on me."
"Very Hazy","Takes Haze, an amazing DIPA and make it perhaps the best beer I've ever had.  Very Green may be the only beer that comes close to competing in terms of all facets of beer.  Simply an incredible beer with all the right flavors, mouthfeel, smell and look.  Another exceptional beer perfected by Treehouse."
"Very Hazy","Poured from a can dated 6/2/16."
"Very Hazy","Can dated 6/2, it is only hours old! This beer pours a completely opaque golden orange identical to orange juice. The head is slow to form but ends up being huge, dense and bright white. Retention is excellent and there are webs of lacing down the entire glass. Smell is amazing. Easily the best smelling beer I have ever encountered, if I could rate it a 6 I would. Orange, peach, pineapple, grapefruit, and dank citrus pith explode out of the glass. No joke you can smell it from across the room. Taste is the same with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Feel is amazing, cannot believe this is 8.6%. It is so soft, smooth, and sticky with a little prickle from the bitterness on the finish. Overall what can I say? Only beer I have ever rated a perfect 5. There is literally nothing that could be done to improve this beer. Perfection in a can."
"Very Hazy","Pineapple, mango, dank bomb.  Lucky to get my hands on one of these in trade at the last Swish release.  Bomb!"
"Very Hazy","A: Very Hazy (haha) golden straw...really, you can't see through the beer at all. Copious head with super fine carbonation."
"Very Hazy","Just wow!"
"Very Hazy","Look - That signature TH/New England look. Haze for days. Looks like juice in the glass. Beautiful. "
"Very Hazy","16 oz can poured into a Tree House teku. Pours a light peach color with hazy body (ironic, I know). Minimal white head and lots of lacing. The aromas are mind-blowing. The only other beer that has shocked me this much was Juice Machine... aromas of tropical fruits dancing around. The flavors definitely follow suit with peaches, pineapple, tangerines, and other tropical citrus fruits. There is a little bit of dank and minimal malt; the ABV is well hidden with this one! The carbonation is on point and mouthfeel is very creamy. Overall, this is an absolutely phenomenal DIPA from the aromas, to the tastes, to the mouthfeel, to the color, and so on... this is worth seeking out! Super drinkable beer! Cheers!"
"Very Hazy","Creamy mouthfeel compared to regular Haze"
"Very Hazy","16oz can served in a snifter glass."
"Very Hazy","One of the top beers(if not the top) that I've ever tasted. Fantastic nose and soft citrus grapefruit taste. Can't taste the 8.6% at all. Only wish they were closer. Exceptional!!!"
"Very Hazy","Another delicious tropical fruit offering. Really hard pressed to say if it's any better than Haze. It's thicker, a tad more bitter. Beautiful color. I'll be back."
"Very Hazy","If they don't have this in heaven, then I don't wanna go. This is perfection in a can."
"Very Hazy","It's great, but I prefer regular Haze.  This is still better than 99% of other Imperial IPAs, but it is just not as drinkable as it's baby brother, in my opinion."
"Very Hazy","Pours from can into a tulip.  Golden, opaque, with a hint of orange.  White foam that dissipates quickly."
"Very Hazy","Have had this many time, and definitely prefer regular Haze. It's a bit overdone. Too heavy and flabby, but still very tasty. Haze is focused and elegant. This beer is a bit sloppy..."
"Very Hazy","-Hazy orange juice without pulp. Bright white lacing"
"Very Hazy","L:  Yellow orange in color, opaque.  Paler and not as bright as other TH beers.  Nice bright white head that sinks down to a thin film.  "
"Very Hazy","Fresh growler shipped to Nebraska out of a snifter."
"Very Hazy","Poured from a growler at a share. Super murky and orange. Could smell this the second the growler got popped open. Dankness and tropical fruits came rushing to my nose. Taste is the same...dankness with tropical fruit. Super creamy. This one lingers a bit. Might be my favorite Tree House beer."
"Very Hazy","Great all around beer from TH.  Gets better once it warms up a bit.  Hops open up more and mouthfeel gets better with time"
"Very Hazy","Canned on 10/14/16. Enjoyed my last one on 2/12/17. "
"Very Hazy","Purchased and canned on 4-15."
"Very Hazy","Nice dank juice bomb. Very creamy with a nice smooth finish. Pours yellowish orange. Becomes more juicy as the time passes. The beer burps are top notch with this one."
"Very Hazy","Not the biggest Haze fan, but these pumped up versions from Tree House are always amazing. This is beyond dank. I was searching for chunks of hops in the glass. Hops to the point of murdering you palate, it a good way! KJ and VG are better, but still awesome!"
"Very Hazy","The only fault Very Hazy has going for it is that it's put out by the same brewery that make King Julius; so despite it's amazingness, it can't even be given credit as the best DIPA the brewery makes.  Outstanding nose of course, and that color...so beautiful.  As mentioned, it's not quite KJ, but it rises above its brothers Very Green and Doppelganger."
"Very Hazy","Best TH beer I've had, and the best DIPA I've had."
"Very Hazy","Definitely a five for me.  This beer tasted better 3 weeks old than the day I got it.  It tasted very fresh, awesome taste, smelled great, went down sooo smooth, might be better than King Julius.  This was awesome"
"Very Hazy","Love those flip top growlers!  Filled Feb 18 and was still drinking pretty amazing 5 weeks later!  Tons of Juicy hops as you would expect...can't imagine what it tastes like 5 weeks ago!!"
"Very Hazy","Pours out the typical haze for daze orange. Smell is very unique; peaches, mango, and apricots. The taste follows suit with the typical th mouthfeel. A step up from regular haze. This is actually pretty different because it has a somewhat dry aftertaste. And the fruits are lighter fruits like apricots and peaches and maybe some mango. Amazing again"
"Very Hazy","I've had many TH lately, and this one may be my favorite of all.  Perfect flavor, well balanced, juicy, but not overdone.  Certainly worth a trip when this is being poured or canned."
"Very Hazy","White head with lace. Super hazy golden yellow."
"Very Hazy","Look: yellow grapefruit juice. Completely opaque with a nice finger to two finger head of tiny bubbles."
"Very Hazy","Pours cloudy orange, hazy with a two finger head.  Smells of dankness and citrus, peppery hops.  Taste is a quick bready malt into a tropical smooth beer.  That sweet citrus really blasts in.  Bitter on the back, but smooth and delicious.  Wow... this beer did not disappoint."
"Very Hazy","Poured from a can into a teku. Essentially a more concentrated Haze - huge, juicy beer with an unbeatable mouthfeel. Although I prefer Green to Haze, Very Hazy exceeded Very Green IMO. A well executed DIPA."
"Very Hazy","Haze just got enhanced with even more pungent dank hops and grapefruit juice. Beer is out of control, Haze 4 Daze!! Would love to have this on tap one day"
"Very Hazy","Of the imperials, King Julius, Very Hazy, Very Green, and Doppelganger- this is my favorite. Absolutely well balanced as opposed to the others which were just more the ingredients, this actually felt like it took artisanship to maintain the integrity of its younger brother. Very fluffy, soft and delicate, just beautiful."
"Very Hazy","Where to begin. If Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath were beers, and they had a drug infused three way in a college dorm....this would be the ""whoopsie"" offspring of the three titanic beasts. Epic juice/hop bomb, surpasses King Julius and Juice Machine in the ""juice"" department, and also successfully eclipses Haze, which in my opinion is one of TH's most delicious beers. Best IPA/DIPA I've had from this phenomenal brewery."
"Very Hazy","Holy crap, I don't know how it could get much better. My favorite IPA that I've had from Treehouse.  The hop aroma and flavor is very unique.  Subtle pine, but oozing tropical fruits. I need more of this in my life."
"Very Hazy","UNREAL! Treehouse can do no wrong! Been sitting on this one for a week and it still tastes fresh as hell! Typicall Treehouse juicy / hazy goodness. Creamy mouth feel keeps you coming back for more. Wish these guys were closer!"
"Very Hazy","pours nice thick pulpy goodness.  can't see through this.   nose is strong grapefruit and some orange.  really nice.   taste is upfront palate bitterness of orange rind followed by sine nice peach and apricot sweetness rounding out the brew.   very end bitterness lingers.  this beer is great but so is haze.  not sure if this is an upgrade but definitely world class.  ive tried all the double versions and to me doppleganger is still the best.edit:  did side by side w haze.   this version is almost the same but had better nose.   more bitterness and slightly more flavor.   very good.   I originally thought haze was better but the more I drank this comes out ahead."
"Very Hazy","Extremely hazy, grapefruit color, with an incredible juicy nose and taste. Absolutely amazing. One of the best IPA's I've ever had, hands down. Grab a can if you can find one."
"Very Hazy","This is pretty much my ideal IPA."
"Very Hazy","Look- same color as grapefruit juice, completely opaque, pours a half finger of white, thin head that retains pretty well."
"Very Hazy","Ridiculous!! Hands down the best beer I've ever had. Perfect balance of hoppy-ness and juicy fruit flavors. Every time I take gulp I taste some additional favor and I'm left wanting more."
"Very Hazy","Pours orange hazy and looks like orange juice with a nice 1/2 inch foamy head. Smells of tropical fruits. Tastes much the same and it finishes with a nice bitter finish. Very little alcohol taste. Wonderful wonderful beer."
"Very Hazy","Had it from a growler poured fresh that day and it blew my socks off. Just had a can of it last night and it was extremely underwhelming. Gonna try it again tonight to see what's up."
"Very Hazy","From can. Very hazy indeed. Blood spatter lacing. Thin head but keeps well. Intense citrus smell. Wide array of fruit on the taste. Juicy, sweet, and a bit of bitter peel. Good carbonation, bit of stick. Nice feel. Another great TH ipa."
"Very Hazy","Pours a hazy golden color, thick white head that dissipate some upon drinking. Strong lacing on the glass. Smell is dank, tropical grapefruit, citrus. Tastes reflect the same, nice balance of tropical and dank. Mouthfeel is straight smooth velvet. Incredible beer"
"Very Hazy","L: Light peach colored hues and of course the requisite hazy body; minimal white head"
"Very Hazy","Very hazy yellow color.  Huge nose of citrus and sweet hops. The taste follows the nose with a little bit of bitter balance.  The feel is both very full an refreshing.  A fantastic beer, one of tree house best."
"Very Hazy","up there with some of the best beers ever.. the color is a dark straw orange.. smell is huge citrus with some dank... the flavor is a burst of dried citrus fruit.. has come dank... closest beer to Headroom I have ever had... absolutely world class... unreal..."
"Very Hazy","Poured from the 16 oz can dated 02/18/16 (with a nice ""Haze me bro"" tag underneath), 7 days old. This beer  lives up to its name and comes out opaquely hazy, orange juice colored, nice foamy head leaves beautiful lacing. Perfection!"
"Very Hazy","Look:  Very clear (just kidding, quite turbid!), little head and a tan/golden hue."
"Very Hazy","Poured from a 750 ml. Growler bottled on Thursday February 18th."
"Very Hazy","Pours that classic hazy color."
"Very Hazy","Pours a dull gold with a murky clarity and a creamy, bright white head.  Nose expresses pith and juicy citrus aromas.  Taste reveals dull citrus and an earthy quality.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild carbonation.  Overall - decent, but not my favorite TH offering."
"Very Hazy","A: Pours the perfect ""hazy"" pale yellow color with a nice white fluffy head and lacing all the way down the glass."
"Very Hazy","L - Classic hazy (pun intended) golden orange with two fingers of white head"
"Very Hazy","Great juicy beer!  The orange and pineapple aromas hit me hard. The mouth feel is full with very little bitterness. A great one from our brewery of choice."
"Very Hazy","Nearly a perfect beer! Awesome nose, appearance and flavor. Assuming you can snag some soon, this beer doesn't disappoint. One of the best that Tree House has created to date!"
"Very Hazy","L - pure clementine juice. Floury haze with a peachy turbid murkiness. Reminds me of a lighter Green. In the right light, it looks like fresh-squeeze pink grapefruit juice. Thin, crisp head to top it all off. "
"Very Hazy","Poured from a 16 oz can. 2/18/16 canning date. Haze Me Bro!"
"Very Hazy","Big thanks to Dean."
"Very Hazy","Huge thanks to Dean for hooking us up with this one. Sounds awesome. Shared with JLindros."
"Good Morning","Nothing short of amazing.  A beautiful beer all around."
"Good Morning","I tried this beer before I knew what it was and I'm glad I did. It's nowhere near as good as hype suggests. It's a nice rich maple and coffee stout but there are others out there that can be had for far less effort and cost."
"Good Morning","A few ounces from a plastic cup at a local beer festival. I'm not sure that's fair to review, but it was happily consumed. Delicious but certainly not groundshaking. Kind of sweet and flat. Tasted like mocha syrup."
"Good Morning","Treehouse never seems to disappoint. This beer is one of smoothest and most delicious stouts out there."
"Good Morning","Late on the review on this....Had from a 750 swing top growler...fantastic beer. Loads of coffee, maple....absolutely worth the hype"
"Good Morning","small pour at a beer festival, which after tasting I wish I hadn't because it was so good, and such a small sample: wanted gallons of it. Smell is maple chocolate and coffee. Mouth feel is velvet, soft and sticky, low carbonation. Taste is perfect: burnt espresso, chocolate, hints of maple and maltiness. Maddeningly good."
"Good Morning","Drank from grower on 9/11. Maple had dissipated but the coffee was strong and the carbonation remained solid. Worth the hype it with the maple absent it was still a very solid brew and hopefully I can have it again."
"Good Morning","Easily one of the best beers I've ever had.  Really opened my eyes up as to what one of the best beers in the world would taste and the quality of it."
"Good Morning","Enjoyed at a share. Pours a deep rich black color, half finger of frothy brown head. Smell is roast coffee. Taste follows the nose, delicious. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy, smooth, not as much there as I anticipated given the appearance. Overall one of the best stouts I've ever had."
"Good Morning","One of the best beers you will ever experience. This beer is only produced twice a year (on average), and each customer is limited to only one 750 ml bottle per pass through the growler line. But it is worth it!"
"Good Morning","From a share a while back shortly after its 2nd release.   Prob the best stout I've had to date.  Lots of sweet syrup on the nose and pallet.  Good fresh coffee presence and notes of vanilla and cocoa.  Great mouthfeel and overall just a killer stout."
"Good Morning","Incredible stout... I was lucky enough to be part of a few shares now where we have opened a few of these growlers and wow.. The hype is real on this super well rounded and balanced maple stout. Great coffee on the nose and a head that looked like cake batter"
"Good Morning","Growler shared in London - picked up in a trade. Pours oily black with a frothy brown head. Huge coffee nose with accents of maple syrup, hearty roast, cocoa. Big and sweet, with maple syrup-laced coffee, dark chocolate, espresso, mellow earthy bitterness, vanilla, creamy coffee ice cream. Full bodied, chewy, with fine to average carbonation. Warming finish with loads of milk chocolate, oily maple syrup, of really brewed coffee, burnt sugars, scorched earth. This stuff is full on. Nice blend of chocolate, coffee and maple syrup. Definitely sweet, but really delicious overall. Outstanding."
"Good Morning","as a person that had many of the best coffees beers, this is just weak compared to morning delight of KBS, really good, dont get me wrong, but weak, Im talking about the stout part, what makes it a beer. The coffee, is a secondary score, that while strong, it dont mask the fact its not a amazing stout."
"Good Morning","Amazing aroma and flavor! Coffee and maple syrup perfectly balanced. This stout is so good, it can easily compete with the best BA imperials!"
"Good Morning","Superb maple coffee stout. That TH creamy mouthfeel with perfect balance of sweet maple, bitter coffee, and roast. On-point carbonation and head. Kept me awake a while from the caffeine buzz, be sure to drink early."
"Good Morning","Fantastic aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. A bouquet of coffee and syrup rush up your nose and the barrel adds to the back end."
"Good Morning","One of the best beers that I have tasted"
"Good Morning","Probably the best stout I have ever had.  I've had this great beer four different times and it is delicious every time.  It is very smooth with such a perfect after taste.  Highly recommend this."
"Good Morning","Pours a pitch black color, with a thin bubbly, light brown colored head. The initial pour consisted of a lot of green peppers aromas. After letting it sit and breathe for a few minutes, the green pepper lessened and more dark roasted coffee and and nice maple syrup aroma started to come out, as well as a decent chocolate malt background. The flavor didn’t have any green pepper to speak of, but was definitely maple forward, which followed through into some nice mocha notes. A really nice fresh roasted coffee bean flavor and a fudgey finish. The body was a tad thin, though it had a creamy consistency to give the beer a “coffee with creamer’ impression. Overall, a great beer with a couple minor flaws. Coffee Stouts (with/without maple syrup) in general are some of my favorite beers. Would I put this one ahead of some of my favorites? Definitely not, but I could certainly see putting it in my top 10 of beers of this style, and I wouldn’t hesitate to drink it again."
"Good Morning","One of my favorite beers. Definitely my favorite stout. Very well-rounded. Great look, smell, taste, mouth feel... I have only good things to say about it. I had heard a lot of hype before I tried it, and I was not disappointed."
"Good Morning","absolutely awesome!!"
"Good Morning","had a 3oz tasting from a growler"
"Good Morning","Here it goes. Filled in November, consumed nye. This lives up to the hype. Pours out a nice black color. Smells like I just walked in to caribou coffee with some maple sweetness and chocolate. Tastes like a Maple covered coffee bean. Yum. What a great way to kick off 2016."
"Good Morning","Poured into a Treehouse Teku Glass - Thanks Leo!"
"Good Morning","Had a growler of this, about 2 days after picking it up. Tough to wait that long, but I shared it with a friend so that makes it worth it, right? Poured it into my Treehouse Tulip, which unlocks a new flavor profile. "
"Good Morning","Best coffee stout I've ever had, hands down.  As soon as the growler was popped it smelled like having a an amazing bag of freshly roasted beans in the room.  The taste absolutely lived up to how glorious the nose was on this brew.  Truly a masterpiece.  I think I shed a tear when it was over..."
"Good Morning","This beer will make you think of a cold winter morning in front of a fireplace watching it snow. It is so smooth and refreshing at the same time. I will savor this beer to the last drop."
"Good Morning","Amazing. Complex. Smooth and velvety."
"Good Morning","1500th rating. I have too many reviews/ratings backed up. Had to open this. "
"Good Morning","Where do I start with this...750 mL growler from the 11/2015 batch. How can so much flavor be packed into a non-bba stout? Strong coffee, maple nose. Taste is caramel, coffee, maple with an amazingly light fluffy body. If I had to have one beer on a desert island...."
"Good Morning","Phenomenal beer. Had at EBF, so really need more of this in a full glass."
"Good Morning","This is the best stout I have ever tasted. I'm more of an IPA guy but good morning is everything and more. I could of drank the whole bottle by myself. It's full of fast and aroma. Definitely worth the number one spot."
"Good Morning","I cannot believe this is not barrel aged. This has become my favorite non barrel aged stout of all time and the contest is not close. Incredibly complex flavor with nice notes of chocolate and bitter coffee and a delicious thick pour."
"Good Morning","Dark with aroma of coffee. Sticky in mouth hints of maple."
"Good Morning","What can I say about Good Morning that hasn't already been elaborated?  This is one of the best smelling, best looking and best tasting beers there is.  Tree House nails it on all levels, and it's easy to see why it gets such high marks.  It wasn't quite as thick as I was expecting, but that's a very small knock on an otherwise perfect beer."
"Good Morning","Growler poured into a sifter."
"Good Morning","Waited in the cold for two and half hours and then another hour and a half for my one 750ml fill.  To say my expectations were high was an understatement.  Thankfully this beer lived up to it.  Pours jet black with very little head.  The aroma of coffee and maple draw you in.  The first sip your hit with delicate coffee and it finishes with maple and a hint of dark chocolate.  All around excellent beer.  My only complaint is it begs to be consumed with breakfast.  Reminds  me of a really good traditional Irish Coffee."
"Good Morning","Waited in a long line at Treehouse to get a growler (one per person limit). Poured into TH teku; jet black in color with minimal head. The aroma is big with lots of coffee and maple. The initial taste just blew me away; now I know why this is the #1 beer right now! You get the initial coffee which finishes which the rich maple and some chocolate. There is minimal heat too. The body is medium; not too light and not too thick. Overall this will definitely blow your socks off; just the perfect beer. Get your hands on some if you haven't already! The hype over this one is totally real. I even shared a little with my brother and his initial reaction was ""WOW!"" This has become my #1 beer in 2015 for sure. Cheers!"
"Good Morning","Bought two of 750s 11/13 when TH released unannounced, which was a freaking awesome surprise."
"Good Morning","Wonderful non BA stout that has bitter coffee and roast and plenty of maple syrup once it warms up. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would like but still velvety. All around a great beer, number 1 in the world good? No but until KBBS is mass produced, this works hahaha"
"Good Morning","Growler dated 11/21 and drank on 12/3"
"Good Morning","750 ml 8/20/15"
"Good Morning","Growler from 11/13/15 release.  Smell of maple and coffee are immediate when the growler pops open.  Taste is intense coffee with a wonderful maple kick, lingering with chocolate on the back end.  Very nice mouthfeel, not too much, not to little, leaving a nice sugary film on the tongue.  Amazing beer!!"
"Good Morning","there was a lot of hype surrounding this beer.  tried it at a bottle share and the growler leaked a bit via trade.  Still had plenty of head when poured into tasting snifter.  Smell had maple and taste was sticky but didn't blow me away with maple taste.  Very solid Imp. Stout...not sure if the leak had any adverse effect on the taste."
"Good Morning","An amazing beer. The maple taste and smell are juts right - not too sweet. Leaves you wanting more."
"Good Morning","this beer is perfect. Smell maple from the crack of the growler... then its a pitch black with a dark mocha head... smell of coffee and maple and the taste follows. its mouthfeel is amazing.. i wouldnt change anyhting about this beer except me getting it more."
"Good Morning","Tried this at the Morning Delight release and Morning Delight blew it away!!! I prefer KBBS over  both of these, but it was a decent beer. The look and smell did not match the taste and feel!!"
"Good Morning","Great maple/coffee imp stout. Each of the flavor profiles are distinct, but well-integrated. Nothing to quibble with here. Is this the best beer in the world? Let's not go there, but this a sweat treat. Thanks Mike."
"Good Morning","Look -  pours a black coffee hue, with a slight froth "
"Good Morning","I had the pleasure of being able to trade for a fresh growler of this dated 11.15.15.  Additionally I was able to drink it side by side with BCBCS. Good Morning is a smooth, wonderfully coffee flavored stout. There is little to no burn and it avoids the sweetness that BCBCS has to it. It's a solid 5, and deserves its top rating."
"Good Morning","Best stout I've ever had and it's really not even close. Maple, coffee and chocolate explosion! Thanks Tree House!"
"Good Morning","This is possibly the best stout I've ever had to date. The only thing that has this beat in any category is Morning Wood in the Aroma category. Morning Wood has unreal amounts of maple on the nose. everything else Good Morning takes a 5. Split this between friends & family, few had a hard time believing it was beer, coffee maple candy was a popular description amongst the group. From flavor to mouthfeel this is just unreal, well done Tree House team."
"Good Morning","Incredible stout, excellent flavor from start to finish."
"Good Morning","Hard to live up to the hype around this. Really great coffee forward stout with a nice subtle maple, didnt quite give me the wow reaction i was hoping for. Wouldnt break the bank to trade for this but glad to have ticked it."
"Good Morning","Phenomenal beer. Great smell, taste, and mouth-feel. The best way to describe this beer is to say it puts a smile on your face."
"Good Morning","Incredible maple flavor and a superb non barrel aged stout. World-class"
"Good Morning","Poured from growler into pint glass."
"Good Morning","750 ml growler into a tulip - consumed a week after the fill date. Huge coffee notes initially and a nice maple to round it out once it warms. More coffee forward than MD and thinner, as expected due to the lower ABV. Excellent beer but not quite world class IMO."
"Good Morning","Pours dark and creamy, dark colored froth on the top of the glass.  Smells of rich chocolate and coffee, light booziness.  Not smelling much in the realm of maple.  Taste is a wave of coffee, cocoa.. bitter dark chocolate, but creamy.  Then comes a wave of the syrup.  This is the flavor of real maple syrup.  Really stands out the more you drink, but it's not overpowering.  As a mostly-novice stout drinker this is phenomenal.  Certainly stands as the best stout I've ever had, which is a reflection on the fact that it's approachable to anyone.  This is a legendary beer."
"Good Morning","If only 6's were available"
"Good Morning","Growler filled at brewery on 11/21/15; drank in a Tree House tulip glass on the same day; the aroma of this beer makes me re-think my Smell ratings of all other stouts; it is a rare thing and extremely satisfying when the hype equals the reality; best stout I have ever had in my life"
"Good Morning","This beer lives up to the hype. Pours almost black with a brown head. It smells like a Sunday Morning should. Heavy coffee and maple scents as soon as you pop the top. It tastes just like you'd expect it to, AMAZING. One of the best beers you will ever drink. So unbelievably lucky to live right down the street from treehouse."
"Good Morning","By far one of my personal favorite beers ever.Great smell to it when you first pop open that top. The aroma of the beer when you pour it really oozes right out of the glass and into your nose. Once you lift that glass for your first sip I hope you are ready for your mind to be blown. You get this nice thick syrup of a beer in your mouth from the first sip to the last. I have had dreams of getting to the bottom of the container after it is poured and rubbing my face and some pancakes around in the residue that is left over. If only I could that someday. I must  though this beer drinks very nice for a stout, heavy but not overbearing, light but not too light. I recommend a nice big tulip glass to let all of the flavors and aromas to develop before placing this delicious syrup in your mouth."
"Good Morning","I am not a big fan of stouts but this is something else. It reminds me of peaty Islay single malt in terms of its potency packed with flavors. Almost need to drink this on a snifter because the nose is quite complex. Leave your emptied glass and come back an hour later to find the room filled with coffee aroma. Just an awesome brew that's perfect for this time of the year. Flavors really pop as you warm it up a bit. I took points off because it's moderately more carbonated than what I expected but otherwise well-deserving of the hype."
"Good Morning",I'm
"Good Morning","Poured from a 750ml growler into a TH teku:"
"Good Morning","750ml growler into a Grrrz teku. Shared by schen9303. "
"Good Morning","This one made me a fan of stout! And I am an IPA kind of guy."
"Good Morning","Looks great, pours black, but minimal head. Lots of maple candy aroma. In aroma terms, the maple definitely overwhelms the coffee. You could smell the maple through the bottle/or the residuals from the fill. It smells phenomenal. Flavored coffee tends to err on the side of too sweet. This toes that line somewhat. There is a ton of residual, unfermented sugar that provides some nice sweetness that leads to a decadent mouthfeel. It leaves the flavor of waffle crisp, which is very accessible at local grocery stores. I like this beer, but it is very, very sweet and that kind of takes away from it as a whole. I wish there was more pronounced coffee and roasted malt. The maple overwhelms all."
"Good Morning","Best coffee RIS punch you in the olfactory I've ever experienced. The maple lets itself be known in spades too...and the taste follows suit. The perfect blend of rich, roasty coffee and authentic tasting maple syrup with little to no alcohol to be found. You also get caramel, vanilla, brown sugar and richest of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is perfect, a bit thicker than KBS and not quite BCBS, but perfectly drinkable.  Looking forward to getting some next time. There is honestly nothing I would change about this, hence the 5."
"Good Morning","Yes. It is that good. I rarely agree a beer is worth the hype.  This one totally is."
"Good Morning","Easy $ 5. Pours black with a multifinger chocolate head that doesn't quit. Beautiful lacing. Smells great. First whif of maple followed by a rich chocolate. Taste is phenomenal. Sweet but not overbearingly so. Like I dumped chocolate chip pancakes smothered in maple syrup into my morning coffee. Super rich and smooth. Light carbonation. Well deserving of the hype."
"Good Morning","Whoa. "
"Good Morning","This was a great beer, a bunch of flavor layers.  pitch black with a small brown head. Chocolate, coffee, Maple and roast nose. Taste similar, like dunking a maple covered donut into fresh roasted coffee with a hazelnut creamer. Little light on the feel compared to the other stout we tried side by side (Morning delight) overall this is a outstanding beer that was worth the hype."
"Good Morning","Incredible beer. Smells like it's ingredients (aka delicious), beautiful, dark brown in the glass, silky smooth mouthfeel that complements the melded flavors of chocolate and maple syrup. Wish there were more maple stouts out there, but I can't imagine anything better than this."
"Good Morning","L - thinner in look with a creamy tan head"
"Good Morning","The maple refused to quit with this one; ridiculously thick, chewy, and decadent. A real treat."
"Good Morning","Maple, Coffee, chocolate, dark malts, very sweet, about the only flaw, delicious dessert beer but could drink a bomber easily.  Really smooth.  Well done."
"Good Morning","One word could describe this beer; AMAZING!  Maple, coffee stout bomb!  Great aromas followed by a fantastic taste and really liked the little kick from the maple.  IMHO, this beer gives MD a run for the money!"
"Good Morning","Really well done beer.  Couple week old swingtop.  Great coffee roasty nose, didn't get any maple.  Taste pretty much follows the nose: roasty coffee with a sweet finish that must be the maple; no maple flavor comes through though.  Mouthfeel is medium to thin and a bit dry surprisingly, maybe from the prominent coffee.  Overall the beer is very drinkable because of the lighter mouthfeel and mellow sweetness.  Very good coffee stout but I can't say there was much maple besides a general sweetness.  Everyone compares this and MD but as far as I can tell these are very different beers that are being compared just because they use the same adjuncts."
"Good Morning","This beer breaks the 5 point rating system"
"Good Morning","maybe someone screwed us over and sent us the wrong beer, but what is in this growler is not what is described. yes the beer was filled probably 5 weeks ago which is not as fresh as I would like. this tastes like a straight up porter. lots of char. roastiness. maybe my expectations were too high...maybe it is too old? maybe it is the wrong beer? probably not. I get a little maple, I get some coffee but it comes across as a porter. good, not great..."
"Good Morning","Maple, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, caramel, amazingness.  Smells like breakfast: coffee and maple syrup.  So many flavors coming through, you'd have have a different experience each time drinking it I'd guess.  Feels as heavy as can be, but is slippery smooth."
"Good Morning","Growler filled 8/22 and drank on 9/13. Still drank great after 3 weeks. The look is pitch black with a dark brown head that slowly disappears. The feel is not super thick but not thin eaither. Carbonation is perfect, a very smooth beer to drink. Smells wonderful, mostly of coffee and chocolate with some faint maple. Taste is roasty with a great coffee flavor and loads of chocolate. Can definitely see what people mean by brownie batter with this one. The maple comes last and coats the mouth. A perfect amount of sweetness that is not too over the top. This is a fantastic beer I hope to drink again. One of the best maple beers I have had although there hasn't been too many."
"Good Morning","Saved this for #2000 and it doesn't disappoint! Not sure if there's anything to add here as I think the ratings speak for themselves."
"Good Morning","ridiculous.  all that needs to be said."
"Good Morning","Finally having some from a growler purchased at Tree House on 8/20/15, poured into a Tree House tulip glass. Looks amazing with a dark, dark pour. Smells amazing, hit immediately with coffee as well as slight chocolate. Feel is smooth. At first taste, you're hit with chocolate immediately, followed by that great maple flavor, with a slight coffee after taste. Best stout I've ever had! Another amazing beer by Tree House."
"Good Morning","L: Viscous, smooth and creamy."
"Good Morning","~8oz pour at Hop Jam in Bolton, VT--8/21/15."
"Good Morning","The hype is real"
"Good Morning","Not sure I understand what all the rave is with this beer.  Did a side by side with Mornin' Delight.  Smells good, but not OMG, like MD.  Mouthfeel is a little thin and I got a slight oxidized flavor with it (but that could just be the growler)."
"Good Morning","Solid stout! DARK as night , smooth with coffee all in your face. ABV hidden well, great job!"
"Good Morning","Finally, Always seem to miss out on this one."
"Good Morning","All maple, all day.  Nice and rich pour, poured hard to get some head and to let the maple shine.  Smelled almost entirely of maple syrup with a little bit of chocolate and roast underneath for some backbone.  Taste was similar with the roast coming out a little bit more with the maple on the edges and at the end.  Thick for the ABV, really a good balance here.  Awesome beer!"
"Good Morning","This is just a spectacular beer in every way. Smell is chocolate, coffee, maple syrup.  Sweet and thick even in the nose. Flavors are gigantic. Rich sweet maple syrup tones and a wonderfully sweet coffee backbone especially as it warms. I happened to be stopping when it released last but would now make the trip if at all possible next time it releases."
"Good Morning","Probably the most flavorful beer I have ever had.  Rich notes of coffee and sugar, obviously from the maple syrup.  If you don't want your beer to be coffee flavored or sugary, that could be your excuse to not give this a 100.  It's the best non-barrel aged beer I have had, might be my favorite.  Totally worth the 2 hour wait... That my friend stood in line for:)"
"Good Morning","Poured at bottle share night prior to MD release. Growler filled the week prior."
"Good Morning","Absolutely gorgeous beer.  Pours a thick black with a big foamy dark tan head."
"Good Morning","This beers pours and espresso black with just a rim of brown crema.  Nose is dominated by coffee character with maple sweetness apparent.  Taste is a combination of coffee with cherry notes and warming boozy notes.  While I don't think there is actually fine ground coffee in the brew the finish left me feeling for it.  Great beer."
"Good Morning","Great strong cold press coffee nose and loads of maple, pours pitch black with small  thin head.  The maple syrup is noticeable but the coffee is so super smooth and very little astringency or bitterness which is simply amazing.  Silky smooth mouthfeel and that awesome maple syrup finish.  I could drink this every day for breakfast."
"Good Morning","I had the pleasure of having this at the Morning Delight release. This is a baby brother to MD. That is not to say it plays second fiddle by any means. This beer was just as amazing. What really stood out to me was the classic pillowy soft body and mouthfeel this beer had for a coffee/maple forward beer. Usually these beers will tend to sway either way on the noticeably sweet or coffee burnt roast/bitter. This beer balanced in harmony with roast and sweet. I could easily drink another glass. Less of a sipper than MD, but it makes sense considering the ABV difference."
"Good Morning","Simply amazing. One of the best stouts I've had so far in my early ventures into craft beer. Awesome maple and coffee, not too overpowering, just enough to blend well with the base stout. Nose is more maple than anything."
"Good Morning","Had this beer during a bottle share yesterday. Not sure how old the growler fill was. "
"Good Morning","750 ml growler filled 8/20, drank today. (First beer of the coffee tasting)"
"Good Morning","750 ml growler. Pours dark black with a medium creamy tan head and great lacing. Aroma is lots of coffee, plenty of maple, cocoa, roasted malts, hints of ashtray. Flavor is light plus sweet, light bitter, lots of maple and coffee, really nice; the good kind of maple."
"Good Morning","Hype is real. Nose for me at first sip was all coffee, but as it warmed I got much more maple. The flavor was similar but got more maple at the beginning than I could smell. Overall this was dang good. I would say the coffee could've been a little less to allow for the maple to show off better. Fwiw I hear a couple months on this beer brings the maple out better. "
"Good Morning","Phenomenal beer.  So great.  Looks like a classic imperial stout but with a rich brown, foamy head. The nose is of sweet amply syrup, with a more subtle coffee undertone. Kind of surprising given how strong of a coffee flavor their double shot has. The taste is more than expected. Definite maple, coffee, sweet and sticky. Nice think velvet body, but Sioux being syrupy. "
"Good Morning","This beer got me to finally join beer advocate. Simply amazing. Best stout I've had so far in my early ventures into craft beer. Awesome maple and coffee, not too overpowering, just enough to blend well with the base stout. Nose is more coffee than maple. Taste is light coffee and light maple, chocolate and some dark fruit? Feel is so crazy thick! So much thicker that my old fav Left Hand milk stout. Overall favorite stout I've ever had, although not near perfect."
"Good Morning","L - Forms a mocha/brown mouse foam on top of a pitch black viscous looking stout"
"Good Morning","For science, had this side by side with Mornin' Delight at TG Mornin' Delight Day. "
"Good Morning","Really liked this beer, glad my girls shared it with me.  Beautiful maple and coffee nose and black coffee look. Taste isn't as good as the nose, but is still exceptional with lots of coffee and smooth maple giving it a toffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is a little lighter than expected.  Had with MD.  Awesome beer.  Really look forward to trying this other side of TH and seeing they're not all hops."
"Good Morning","Had at the MD release, lucky enough to have these two next to each other.  Overall, MD was superior.  GM was superior in smell however, offering a huge maple nose.  Look was very similar to MD, completely opaque dark chocolate. Taste was not as distinct as MD, a bit more muddled, but maple and roastiness were still very much dominating.  GM was a tad thin, but still medium-heavy mouthfeel, not quite as perfectly sticky as MD. Overall solid, hope they get this in bottles soon so I can get something better than a growler."
"Good Morning","Drank 2oz pour from growler. I was initially expecting this beer to be thinker and pour darker. The maple syrup was light at first and only intensified slightly when the beer warmed up. The beer is a solid brew and I wished they bottled it."
"Good Morning","Maybe the best nose I have ever encountered in a beer.  I'm glad I was lucky enough to try this and MD on back to back days. But the mouth feel and flavor tips the scales towards MD. Still...this is a world class beer and one of the best I've had the pleasure to try."
"Good Morning","Exceptional brew. The nose is full of cacao, chocolate fudge, sweet maple syrup, and the slightest hints of roast. The taste is dominated by chewy chocolate fudge. I noticed the roasted coffee next and only a slight hint of maple. The mouthfeel was excellent too. This beer is a beast."
"Good Morning","Great beer.  The first sip you have it's a flavor overload.  I think it is a little too sweet to have a full glass and it as you drink it you realize you don't like it as much.  Still a great beer, a little thin overall but it's very drinkable due to this.  Is it the new king?  Too much of a one trick pony IMO"
"Good Morning","Sorry for the 5-star review, but there seriously is nothing wrong with this beer. It's just plain delicious."
"Good Morning","Got a growler of this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was  huge hit. I have some fairly discerning friends and they all loved this beer.  Nic e dark think creamy head, pours black and really dark, but is smooth, well worth the trek out to Monson."
"Good Morning","Poured pitch black with a small tan head. The smell alone had me sold -  straight coffee, chocolate, hints of sweet syrup and roasting. Packed with delicious bitter coffee flavor, wonderfully balanced by the maple syrup. The flavors just keep coming, dark brown sugar, vanilla, freshly roasted coffee. The beer is perfectly balanced, not overly sweet. I see some wishing for a heavier mouthfeel, but I thought the carbonation level with all the flavoring you encounter was perfect and still silky smooth; any heavier may have taken away from the complexity of flavors. The lacing left behind on the glass looked like a work of art… to the beer drinkers eye."
"Good Morning","Poured from a 750ml growler filled on 8/15/15 and drank on 8/25.  Is this even a beer?  Beer pours out completely pitch black, but not as thick as I might have expected.  Smells heavily of brownies and chocolate, along with some maple syrup and a decent amount of coffee.  I couldn't stop smelling this beer it was so damn delicious; I just wanted to crawl into the glass.  The taste has all the same flavors as the aroma, but I was surprised at just how strong the coffee flavor was, in a very good way.  I was expecting heavier chocolatey notes, but the coffee took a more central role, especially on the mid palate.  Each sip included multiple waves of flavor, and the sweet tasty maple syrup really makes its presence known on the back end.  Not too sweet though, as the coffee, chocolate and maple favors just are balanced so perfectly, but what else would you expect from TH?  Mouthfeel was not as thick as I would have hoped, but it was still great and smooth as all hell.  I really can't think of anything that I would say needs changing to improve on this beer.  If you can get your hands on this beer anyway other than giving up your first born child, DO SO!  Big thanks to PaddyFrankie for hooking me up with this in a trade when I had to miss this in person at the brewery."
"Good Morning","Me being a sweet tooth and the maple flavor being so strong and delicious in this beer it was hard to put the glass down . This is a great holiday beer and relaxing in the winter ."
"Good Morning","Thank you to a friend for his opportunity!  Poured from a 750 ml growler...pitch black...tons of coffee notes! Tan head and lacing.  Amazing coffee notes and finish!!!"
"Good Morning","An absolutely amazing beer of beers. I am not a stout guy by any means but this one for sure made me a believer. The best stout by far that I have ever had and possibly one of the best tasting beers I have ever had! Hats off to tree house! If this was Sold in Bottles instead of Growlers it would be trading like a mega whale!"
"Good Morning","Brewed with Monson’s own Maxwell Road Maple Grade A Dark Amber Maple syrup, Good Morning pours pitch black in the glass with a creamy mousse-like head. The bubbles give way to aromas of rich milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and dark amber maple syrup. The flavor starts as a blast of milk chocolate, sweet maple syrup, and rich fresh coffee as deeper complexities are uncovered as it warms. The crew here at Tree House tastes “chocolate covered maple candy”, “vanilla”, “chocolate cake”, “brown sugar”, and “fresh roasted coffee”. A super decadent treat, Good Morning begs to be shared and contemplated!"
"Good Morning","This is as Close to perfect as you can get to a Stout, without a BA Characteristic.. Amazing"
"Good Morning","Huge thanks to Michael T. For sharing a growler. Currently  the  #1 beer in the world on beeradvocate.com."
"Good Morning","Growler from the source obtained by a friend."
"Good Morning","You really can't make a non BA coffee stout any better than this. It blows away sump and all of its other competitors. Freaky, delicious, loads of coffee and maple. Almost perfect."
"Good Morning","Poured from growler filled on 8/15.  Resembles thickened black coffee as it's poured into a snifter.  This isn't sludgy motor oil.  "
"Good Morning","When I filled my growler on August 14th of 2015, Good Morning was hovering around 38th on Beer Advocate's Top 250 Beers list. It has since made a miraculous ascent into the number spot on that very list, toppling the hop gods of Pliny the Younger and Heady Topper, claiming the title of Best Beer in the World and crowning itself the ultimate whalezbro beer of ever, brah. "
"Good Morning","All aboard the hype train!  Let's see what it's all about.  750 ml growler (obviously) into a snifter."
"Good Morning","Very well done stout. Sweet and cloying. I feel the maple adds to the texture and sweetness but I didn't get much of a maple flavor. The coffee over powers the scent and flavor. Overall a top notch beer"
"Good Morning","750 ml growler, 1 week old, poured into a TH tulip glass..."
"Good Morning","L - Pitch black with a dark brown head. Oozy carbonation when swirled."
"Good Morning","This is a truly world class beer, and yet another home run for Tree House."
"Good Morning","Good Morning is absolutely delicious.  Breakfast in a glass.  There is a ton of flavor packed into this beer.  The maple is very present in the smell and taste.  Had this side by side with my other favorite non-BA coffee stout , Founders Breakfast Stout, and to no surprise, Good Morning was the winner."
"Good Morning","I hate to go with the hype.  This is the second time I've had it.  It really is the best coffee, maple stout I've had.  Extremely flavorful, syrupy and not overly boozy in spite of the high (compared to other non-barrel aged stouts) ABV.  I'd probably tip my hat to some of the Tree House Double Shot variations, though, over Good Morning."
"Good Morning","Perfection in a bottle"
"Good Morning","L - Pours black and viscous, small tan head."
"Good Morning","As a Tree House regular, my expectations for this beer were already high; nevertheless, I was blow away with the complexity of this brew. Hints of maple, chocolate and coffee, it's like a breakfast dessert in your mouth. Pours dark as night and leaves an enchanting lacing on the glassware after each sip. Wish I didn't trade my last bottle away. Hands down, the best beer I've tasted to date."
"Good Morning","L: Pours a dark brown. Inch or two tan head"
"Good Morning","I can not even think of one bad thing to say about this offering from the Tree House crew."
"Good Morning","Poured from a growler dated 8/20/15 into a Tree House tulip."
"Good Morning","Ah Good morning. This beer is absolutely delicious. Beautiful Dark mocha Head. Smell of coffee and sweetness from the maple. Taste like liquid coffee ice cream. Mouth feel lighter than you would think making this beer the best beer in the category"
"Good Morning","another great offering from treehouse"
"Good Morning","Poured completely opaque like oil. This beer is rich, creamy and decadent. Hits you with a huge maple syrup flavor and then chocolate and coffee. Absolutely delicious."
"Good Morning","A: Deep, dark pour. Completely opaque. Minimal mocha head that dissipates quickly."
"Good Morning","Simply the beast offering in the category, ever. Pours dark and thick, light creamy head, smells like the darkest of coffee, feels thick and oily almost on the palette, cascades your entire mouth with, coffee, vanilla, dark caramel, and dark chocolate. Its a game changer. Believe the hype."
"Good Morning","My first review and I figured it couldn't come with a better beer. Smooth as can be. Pours an oily black with a nice brown head. Maple syrup, coffee aroma with an amazing mix of flavors to create the best stout I have ever had. Treehouse knocked it out of the park with this!"
"Good Morning","Incredible Stout ... It's CBS recreated by our friends in Monson.. But way better.. Should be the #1 Stout PERIOD!"
"Good Morning","A: beautiful dark chocolate brown with a moderate tan head. Great pour from a week+ old swing top."
"Good Morning","A - near black with a finger of semi dense chocolate head. So so lacing and retention"
"Good Morning","Oh yeah...great beer"
"Good Morning","Via growler filled 8/13, so something to consider"
"Good Morning","growler filled on 8/20/15, consumed a day later after pouring into snifter"
"Good Morning","Okay let me start this off by saying I have now had a growler of this with 3 days age, 6 days age, 16 days age. Yes separate growlers I didn't decide to age it myself. If you don't drink this immediately then you will lose everything this wonderful beast had to offer you. This beer becomes a shell of what it is in a few short days. I wish that they would bottle this beer. This review is for my fresh batch rating."
"Good Morning","It smells like warm maple chocolate cake with rich maple icing with a cup of coffee. The taste follows the nose maple milk chocolate. Silky mouth feel."
"Good Morning","Easily the best beer I've ever consumed. Bursting with coffee, chocolate, and hints of maple. This beer is best at room temperature. Mind blowing experience.  Growler filled 8/20, consumed on 8/21."
"Good Morning","growler filled 8/15, consumed 8/20"
"Good Morning","How could this beer be rated anything but a five? Wow. Pours jet black with a gorgeous brown toasty head. Tastes of sweet maple syrup, decadent desserts and rich espresso. A masterpiece. This beer lives up to the. Hype!!"
"Good Morning","Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter."
"Good Morning","Poured from a growler which leaked slightly on its way down to Florida. Poured dark brown with a one finger tan head which lingers for a while before giving way. Aroma is rich and decadent with maple syrup, coffee, malt, mocha, and semi-sweet, dark chocolate. I'm down to the last few sips as I write this and the aroma is still going strong. The taste follows the nose. Maple syrup and coffee are amazing, but the flavor really sets itself apart with the varying layers of chocolate. Each sip delivers a different variation - mocha, bitter dark chocolate, creamy vanilla with milk chocolate, fluffy cake, dense fudge, and chocolate chip pancake. There's a lot of malt as well, both sweet, candied malt as well as roasted malt and a bitter astringent note from the coffee that cuts through the sweetness perfectly and keeps everything in balance. The mouth feel is  medium, fluffy, and smooth with just enough carb to keep it moving. I was expecting a light to medium mouth feel based on abv, but was pleasantly surprised by how full it was. I don't want it to be any bigger. The lower abv and mouth feel allow a variety of new experiences to emerge with each sip - malted milkshake, marshmallow, mocha cappuccino, espresso. This is a supremely well-crafted beer. World class."
"Good Morning","Had this multiple times, both in growlers and at EBF. Rating the latest batch, growler filled on 8/15/2015, poured into a Tree House tulip glass."
"Good Morning","So good. Tastes like chocolate pancakes with dark toasty chocolate chips, black strap molasses, and roasty coffee."
"Good Morning","A: Deep, deep brown pour. Completely opaque. Small mocha head, recedes quickly."
"Good Morning","750ml growler filled on August 14. Wow - this somehow exceeded my incredibly high expectations. Silky smooth mouthfeel with layer upon layer of coffee, chocolate, and molasses. The coffee flavor is incredible and complements, rather than dominates, the flavor profile."
"Good Morning","I didn't think I'd ever give a perfect score, but Jesus H. Christ this beer is perfect. "
"Good Morning","Maple syrup overpowers what should be a great beer."
"Good Morning","Black as night in the glass.  Aromas galore!  Taste is amazing... chocolate chip pancakes doused in maple syrup accompanied by a stiff cup of dark roast coffee.  I have no idea how TH does it, but this stout blew my mind with the complexity of all the layers included in one glass.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY STOUT DRINKER!"
"Good Morning","Poured from a 750ml bottle into Reidel Crystal Snifter. Drank fresh, same day by suggestion of staff/co-founder."
"Good Morning","750ml growler, filled two days ago at the brewery. "
"Good Morning","Reviewing Good Morning from Treehouse Brewing Company out of Monson, Massachusetts."
"Good Morning","A: Perfect looking stout. Poured a jet black with nice size tan head and some amazing lacing down the glass."
"Good Morning","Maple to this degree is one of the most difficult flavors to accomplish with how readily syrup attenuates. This is unbelievable, it's taking me forever to write this because I don't want to put my glass down. Belgian waffles dripping in rich syrup. Perfectly roasted coffee that is neither overly bitter or too dominating of the flavor profile. Milk chocolate drizzle tying it all together with just the perfect amount of sweetness in perfect harmony. As somebody who has had a lot of what treehouse has to offer this is undoubtably the king of the castle. Wowed by everything this one brinhs to the table."
"Good Morning","Look: dark dark brown (almost black) with light brown thick foam"
"Good Morning","I really didn't want to give this beer a 5, but as it warms up it can't be anything, but a 5. By the way on a side note, I've had this beer twice about two weeks apart."
"Good Morning","Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed at EBF 2015. This one was like a perfect iced coffee; sweet, smooth, and delicious espresso bitterness. Awesome beer."
"Good Morning","While it is truly a good stout, the hype machine wins with this one. I personally think Double Shot is better, but that's just one man's opinion. Enjoy it for what it is, a good beer."
"Good Morning","Hands down the best beer at EBF 2015!!"
"Good Morning","Absolute Perfection in a Glass!"
"Good Morning","Just perfection."
"Good Morning","Thanks so much Tim!!  Pours a rich dark roast coffee color with a milky creamy head.  Smell is lots of maple syrup and brown sugar with a hint of roasted coffee.  Taste is bitter dark cocoa with espresso and a slight brown sugar sweetness.  Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I expected but is silky and creamy like a dark chocolate mocha with half and half.  Overall this is  one of the best stouts I have ever had.  I have not had Morning Delight but this is in the same league as KBBS.  The aftertaste is very bitter and could use some smoothing out but the balance and flavor profiles are impeccable.  Good morning indeed."
"Good Morning","One of my favorite stouts hand down"
"Good Morning","Maple shines through in the nose and flavor.  Awesome!"
"Good Morning","I wish I could drink this beer every day. That is how good it really is."
"Good Morning","This one deserves a write-up. "
"Good Morning","Overrated.  I wouldn't go out of my way for this.  Smells incredible.  Taste is a bit gimmicky.  Adjunct stouts!!"
"Good Morning","Solids maple imperial stout but highly overrated. Founders breakfast stout is just as good."
"Good Morning","This beer set the mark for me for all things non barrel aged! This is the epitome of what all beers brewed with coffee and or maple should taste like. Full body that hits the pallet with a ton of flavor and the nose does the same. World class and amazing."
"Good Morning","Growler. Dark brown pour with a tan head. Huge coffee aromas with a hint of maple. Sweet with loads of maple, black coffee, and dark roasted malt notes. Caramel and brown sugar backbeats. A bit thin in the body with a very good mouthfeel. A real stunner. Thanks for sharing Collin..."
"Good Morning","Pours dark brown, almost black, with a nice tan head. Absolutely stellar beer. Every time I have it the stuff blows me away. Rich, decadent coffee flavor is accentuated by just the right amount of maple. Liquid chocolate chip pancakes with syrup and coffee drizzled on top. It smells fantastic and the taste matches the nose almost perfectly. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carb."
"Good Morning","The aroma when warmed hits of milk chocolate, fudge, coffee, and an intense maple syrup sweetness."
"Good Morning","This beer is awesome in every way.  Waited 2.5 hrs in line for the right to buy a 750ml growler.  Smell, taste, body just blew me away.  Nearly perfect beer"
"Good Morning","Got two samples, 4 oz total, on tap at EBF in Boston, MA. I wish I could've gotten more."
"Good Morning","Joins a very small list of perfect 5 ratings for me. Amazing depth, complexity and smooth integration. So multidimensional. Great finish and an amazing effort. Perfect."
"Good Morning","I am an IPA guy and have never really had a taste for dark beer of any kind.  This beer, however, is special and should be sought out and tried by any lover of beer.  From the thick/chewy mouthfeel to the delicious aroma and taste each and every drop of this beer was crafted with love.  It's like drinking a unicorn."
"Good Morning","L: a black brown, with a small chocolate head that dissipates quickly  "
"Good Morning","I won't drive 90 minutes to go to Tree House, but I did wait 30 minutes in line at EBF for this .  This beer is good.  My only complaint about it is where it is made.  Tree House needs to move to Boston.  I would then have more.  If you own Tree House please rent a moving van - I enjoyed this beer."
"Good Morning","Poured from a 750 mL growler filled 4 hours ago at Tree House Brewery into a Tree House tulip glass. "
"Good Morning","Pours out black with a thin tan head, the smell it loaded with sweet maple syrup and roasted malts, the taste is much like the nose, nice sweetness throughout but not cloying at all. The feel is silky smooth and very drinkable. Overall it's an outstanding beer."
"Good Morning","Very good. Has a carmelized sweetness reminiscent of the condensed milk in vietnamese coffee. Body was a little syrupy / heavy and the blast of sweetness up front seemed to mute flavor complexity. Delicious but, ultimately, lacking some of the complexity / nuance and  transformation over the finish of the absolute best stouts."
"Good Morning","Multiple pours at Row 34 after the Tree House beer dinner. "
"Good Morning","better than Morning Delight in my opinion"
"Good Morning","Not blown away...syrupy in the maple sense..."
"Good Morning","By far the best beer I've ever had.  It sets a new standard for what beer can be.  Let's put it this way: this trades 1:1 with Vanilla Rye, but I keep these for myself."
"Good Morning","This beer is absolutely as good as it gets for a non BA stout. The coffee/chocolate/maple aromas really burst out and the flavor profile is great as the beer warms. Can't recommend enough."
"Good Morning",Growler
"Good Morning","Best beer I have ever had.  I am completely blown away.  Coffee and maple in perfect balance, beautiful mouthfeel and smells as good as it tastes.  Perfection."
"Good Morning","Maple, Maple, Maple.  This is what I wanted Maple Bacon Coffee Porter to be.  This beer was very full on taste while staying balanced and enjoyable.  One of the best I've ever had."
"Good Morning","A stout with thinner body than I'd normally like to have but has a very robust coffee flavor with a lingering maple finish.  Extremely well done......"
"Good Morning","This is now my favorite beer. Period. Can't wait to try the Boubon Vanilla one."
"Good Morning","split a 750ml growler poured into a Tree House teku."
"Good Morning","Smells like coffee and maple. Taste is incredible, strong coffee adds a bitter note that's offset by the sweet maple syrup taste. Overall, one of, if not the best non BA stouts out there."
"Good Morning","Outstanding beer. I've had the good fortune of trying three different batches (have there been more?) and while the first had the best mouthfeel, I've been blown away every time. The Tree House crew is spot on with all the flavors in their description. A truly decadent desert beer. I haven't had Mornin Delight so I can't compare, but the only beer that might beat this one is Filthy Rich by Lively Brewing."
"Good Morning","750ml bottle poured into a snifter."
"Good Morning","This beer is a total sensory experience. It looks like a decadent dessert, smells like heaven, and makes your taste buds sing with delight. The balance is incredible: too much maple syrup and this would have been cloying; too little and it would be just another (albeit high quality) coffee stout. The carbonation level is absolutely dead-on. Don't drink it too cold, as it needs some warmth to really expose its strengths."
"Good Morning","This is what I would consider a perfect beer !!! Thanks to Denzo for sharing ."
"Good Morning","christ in a basket, where do i begin with this coffe/maple bomb of a beer. the aroma alone is making me moist. sweet maple syrup + a heavy dose of coffee to the schnoz. taste delivers, matching the aroma of this beaut. chocolate, coffee, maple syzurp kick to the teeth i love it. beer of the year imho."
"Good Morning","Appearance- Nearly a black opaque color, but some amber/brown hues on the edges if held in the right light.  Just about a fingers length of a mocha colored head. "
"Good Morning","I've never considered giving 5s across the board, and I almost never even give a single 5, but this beer is a game changer. One of the best overall beersI've ever had. The pour, nose, body, taste, and mouth feel are all perfect. It's rich and decadent and unbelievably satisfying."
"Good Morning","Great maple stout. Cheers to the sugar makers"
"Good Morning","A  - Beautifully jet black, with a distinct, frothy dark tan  head. Thick lacing slowly falls back into the brew."
"Good Morning","an incredible offering in regards to the coffee and maple presence. the first sip explodes in chocolately sweet maple and coffee flavors. unfortunately, a thin base keeps this beer from competing with the other top notch coffee/maple/etc stouts out there. a nice tick and im very glad i got to try it, but there are some shelf coffee stouts out there that beat this one out for me. if they can make the base of this one meatier/thicker, then it could be something special."
"Good Morning","Ive had this beer twice now, absolutely amazing beer. The coffee and chocolate flavors are velvety and perfect, with a great balance of maple."
"Good Morning","One of the best coffee stouts I've had.  Up there with the best bottles of KBS and BCBCS, but it's nice that at 8.4% you can take down a growler without it being a big deal."
"Good Morning","750 mL growler poured into a snifter."
"Good Morning","thank to egrace84 for cracking this 750 swingtop growler!"
"Good Morning","Stunning.  The best adjunct, non barrel aged stout that I've ever had.  Period.  Wonderful coffee and maple notes.  Perfectly balanced.  Slightly coffee forward at first, then moves in to pure maple.  World class."
"Good Morning","750ml growler, filled 11/6/2014. Poured into a snifter 11/13/2014."
"Good Morning","750ml growler filled Nov 1st 2014. Thanks Chico1985 for splitting this with me."
"Good Morning","Good Morning!"
"Good Morning","Have had this three times in growler form.  Not as thick of a mouthfeel with two of the growlers as I had hoped, but great nose and nice blend of flavors here.  Look forward to trying mornin' delight for comparison soon."
"Good Morning","Poured from a 750 ml growler into a tulip glass. "
"Good Morning","This was the best coffee stout I have had to date.  The smell was outta this world. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup, and caramel. Someone said it smelled like dunking donuts should smell and I can't agree more. And the taste, holy shit! This thing is so rich with flavor and almost tastes like a desert rather than a beer. If you have the chance to get this don't think twice grab it. Well worth the wait in the cold rain!"
"Good Morning","So much delicious maple syrup taste. Smells of fresh roasted coffee. Lots of coffee and coconut in the finish. Only thing that could be better is the mouthfeel, wish it was a bit thicker. This is outstanding."
"Good Morning","Poured from a 750 mL growler into a snifter. This was filled at the brewery less than 2 hours ago. This is the 2nd batch of this brew."
"Good Morning","Drank from a 1 pint, 9.4 fluid ounces growler purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
"Good Morning","L - Pitch black with three fingers of light brown head."
"Good Morning","So smooth.  I thought Ten Fidy was the smoothest imperial stout until I have this creation.  It looks like motor oil, smells like the perfect French press steeped coffee, and tastes like New England looks in the fall - magical.   It's creamy, rich, well balanced and never overpowering.  May well be my favorite beer from Tree House."
"Good Morning","I've got to say, tried this beer for the first time at the brewery today, and I haven't been so blown away by a beer in a long time.  This beer is everything I've always wanted from an Imperial Coffee stout."
"Good Morning","Growler thanks to Rich, poured into Side Project Snifter and shared amongst 3 others."
"Good Morning","A: Beautiful: pours a mocha; amber; dark brownish head, with good retention and lacing"
"Good Morning","Scores well in all categories.   Sticky sweet maple stout.   It would be interesting to see them bottle this one to compare against other brews in that format.   But, definitely delicious fresh."
"Good Morning","Growler. Poured a dark, soupy brown with a narrow, dark tan head. Aroma is very decadent. Espresso and maple syrup. Fudge. All aspects of the nose are very rich. Really impressed with how well the maple stands out in the nose. Flavor is also very entertaining. Maple syrup, brownies and fudge, coffee liqueur, bitter espresso and a surprising earthy hop note. Dark chocolate and vanilla. Body is oily and syrupy. Softer carbonation. Sticky, lingering feel with respectable bitterness. Alcohol is smothered by the flavors. This turned out to be a really great beer. Tree House does their dark beers with equal precision to their more attention grabbing hoppy beers."
"Good Morning","Pours one shady shy of black with no head to speak of, just a sudsy slick.  Nose on this beer is incredible!  Bold coffee notes without coming off vegetal, vanilla and maple syrup.  Taste consistent with nose - so sweet (like coffee creamer).  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an mild, even carbonation.  Overall, this is an amazing beer.  One of the most notable beers I've had in a while.  It is reminiscent of Funky Buddha's Morning Wood, minus the barrel."
"Good Morning","Originally really disappointed I couldn't get out to get this, but thankfully Rudzud shared one of his."
"Good Morning","My favorite beer, period. So smooth, the coffee, chocolate, maple all blend so well together. So depressing when you get to the bottom of the glass."
"Good Morning","This was suppose to be an Imperial Double Shot, but it became something else. Something greater."
"Good Morning","Batch 1: From notes- my first review, after hundreds of great beers.  This beer demanded review."
"Good Morning","Pour is rich deep brown with a two finger head"
"Good Morning","Picked up a growler of this about an hour ago from the brewery. This is the latest double shot variant. Double Double Shot with VT beans and local maple syrup.  Poured into my Duvel tulip."
"Mornin' Delight","Batch #4, on tap at 8/19 release. "
"Mornin' Delight","Delicious. Big maple aroma and exploding coffee flavor. I would like more maple. Slightly bitter coffee aftertaste. Nice viscosity. This is an amazing beer."
"Mornin' Delight","Most recent version, not a fan, sickingly sweet with an artificial maple flavor.  Have liked last 2 years versions much more than this so I'll give it better ratings based on prior experience but this year is rough."
"Mornin' Delight","Tasted from draft at Hunahpu Day 16. Pours black with dark brown head. Aroma is maple syrup, bourbon, chocolate and coffee. Taste is super thick and chewy on the mouth. Lot of maple syrup. Flavors also of bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits. Awesome beer."
"Mornin' Delight","Here we go......"
"Mornin' Delight","Very disappointed in this beer. Almost no maple presence. Just an above average coffee stout. I think TG stouts are all hype. If you are looking for a maple bomb, try Wide Awake 2016 or Double Stack. Easier to find and trade for, and taste much better."
"Mornin' Delight","B3 has too much bitterness from the expresso. I quite enjoyed the mouthfeel but got little maple on the nose and no where else and there wasn't any vanilla present."
"Mornin' Delight","Very dark, little head.  Bursting aromas of raw coffee and a slight green pepper note.  Olfactory onslaught when the beer hits your tongue...taste and smell attacks the nasal passage and circulates throughout.  It is truly a coffee bomb, but I prefer a beer with greater density and mouthfeel."
"Mornin' Delight","on draft at the TG taproom"
"Mornin' Delight","Pours inky jet black with a fairly thin khaki head that receded to a thin ring fairly rapidly. Aroma is coffee and more coffee with a hint of chocolate and a faint wisp of maple in the background. The flavor has a tad more chocolate than the aroma, but the coffee really the star of the show. Again only a faint wisp of maple. A tad thin but overall a beautiful stout and a perfect example that no bourbon barrel aging is necessary to create a wonderful beer."
"Mornin' Delight","This beer is not what everyone thinks it is. Total shit beer compared to the hype."
"Mornin' Delight","Finally attained a bottle (b3) of this. The name and description sound on point for what my favorite stouts would be. Best Maple coffee stout I've had to date was Good Morning."
"Mornin' Delight","Finally attained a bottle (b3) of this. The name and description sound on point for what my favorite stouts would be. Best Maple coffee stout I've had to date was Good Morning."
"Mornin' Delight","B1 and b2 maple maple bombs . Amazing beer, thick and delicious just the way all stouts should be"
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Toppling Goliath"
"Mornin' Delight","Pours a dark black color with a rusty tan thin head. Aroma is wood and maple syrup with an espresso roast.  Taste follows nose with a bitter espresso hit on the front end which masks the lovely maple and chocolate that lies below. Mouth feel was overly bitter and on the thin side. Glad i got two pours of this ,its a good brew but will never buy or trade for a bottle , way over hyped and overpriced IMO, Forager Magnus kills this brew."
"Mornin' Delight","Biggest let down of tbbw 17!   Really awesome stout but was purely coffee and maple was gone.....looked exactly the part just didnt deliver the maple i wanted!"
"Mornin' Delight","no denying this is a great beer, but the hype really does almost make this a disappointment no matter what. i remember having my first heady topper after it was the top beer on this site for so long, and i remember loving it, but also thinking man, i know a bunch of other hoppy beer just this good. this is a really dramatically flavored beer, a big chocolate forward base stout with heaps of maple in it, its super well made, and hides its alcohol insanely well, but its almost like no matter what this tasted like, it wasnt going to live up to its top billing. it came about as close as one can considering the hype around this beer, but would i drive 12 hours to iowa and camp overnight to buy this? or would i spend a few hundred bucks on one via the secondary market? absolutely not. i am a maple guy, through and through, and this does have quite a lot of natural maple flavor in it. the coffee is bold and fresh, espresso intensity, and the earthy bitter nature of the coffee keeps the maple from making this too sweet, although it very much still seems like dessert beer to me. the base stout is tasty, but its not uncommon in any way including in quality, but all the chocolate notes in here are amazing with both the coffee and the maple. it seems at its saturation point, maxed out on the amount of flavor it can reasonably hold in it, but there is a balance in its enormity as well, and its just so smooth on the palate, throat coating going down, and leaving a brilliant maple taste on my tongue. almost has a whiskey character to it, and if i think about it, i can taste molasses, brown sugar, cocoa powder, and raisin. breakfasty i suppose, awfully intense, really well done, but just not quite as epic and life changing as it was supposed to be. is that fair?"
"Mornin' Delight","Drank 2015 MD in September of 2016 and another in Feb 2017.  Have also had on draft at 2015 release."
"Mornin' Delight","I was  so excited for this but it was just bitter coffee and no maple. This isn't even a top 5 coffee stout for me"
"Mornin' Delight","This beer is offensively full of maple, may god have mercy on your soul"
"Mornin' Delight","MDb3 had on tap at Toppling Goliath."
"Mornin' Delight","I wanted to hate this beer because of all that it has come to represent in the craft beer world, but after twice receiving a 10 ounce pour for $5 each at the taproom, I was able to go into my first taste of the beer with a more open mind. "
"Mornin' Delight","Dark, smells of coffee and maple, light tan head.  I let this warm up a little after my first sip in the taproom.  The aroma and flavors started to come out as it warmed, and it definitely got better.  "
"Mornin' Delight","10oz pour on tap at Toppling Goliath. Reviewed live at the bar."
"Mornin' Delight","2016 (batch 3). Pours almost black with a brown head. Aroma of coffee. Taste is big sweet coffee and maybe a lil maple syrup. Mouthfeel is nice and smoooth but thinner than I'd expect. Overall, this was a huge disappointment from what it took to obtain it and the hype. There are plenty of $20 beers that will be sufficient enough for what this beer delivers."
"Mornin' Delight","B2. Best non BA stout I've ever had behind Good Morning"
"Mornin' Delight","Batch 2."
"Mornin' Delight","Lots of maple and coffee, very good.  Was hoping it'd be more full bodied but still an awesome beer"
"Mornin' Delight","Poured from a bottle into a snifter, jet black with a bountiful, lasting, and sticky mocha brown head. Coffee early on the nose and palate, but warms up to a very nice interaction with maple, also on the nose and palate. The second pour from the bottle was a waltz of coffee and maple, coffee led but both undeniable.  Mouthfeel was in the moderate range but not disappointing.  Great showcase of coffee maple interaction, with great flavor, but still more rustic than sweet.  Thanks Corey for the trade!"
"Mornin' Delight","2016 vintage. Closest thing to a criticism would be the mouthfeel where the body is a bit light. But the flavor is all there. Coffee heavy with a nice support from the maple. Smooth and incredibly balanced. I need another bottle!"
"Mornin' Delight","Batch 2 into a TG snifter. Pours pitch black with no head. Aroma is all breakfast. Coffee, maple, toffee, vanilla, chocolate. Amazing! Taste is exactly as the nose. So much maple, toffee, vanilla and coffee. I wanted some bacon with it. Feel is slick and creamy. Very coating. Overall, this is the best beer I've ever had. Beats out GM by a tad. Amazing balance of all flavors but all flavors pop so much."
"Mornin' Delight","B3 bottle poured into snifter glass. Rich, black color small tan head. Notes of maple, chocolate and coffee meet the nose. Dark chocolate (slightly bitter, yet rich) and coffee greet the palate and then the maple syrup --- oh my! The well balanced taste lingers on the palate - this is a chocolate donut with a nice maple coating."
"Mornin' Delight","b3 2016. Pours a beautiful dark with lingering creamy tan head. Nose is full maple syrup with fresh coffee. Taste is wonderfully bitter coffee and dark chocolate with maple. Like a maple drizzled dark chocolate glazed donut dipped in espresso. Mouth feel is full without being overly thick. This falls between a 4.8 and 4.9 for me. I think Good Morning may still hold the top spot, although I'm very glad to have had this beer, and will seek it out again."
"Mornin' Delight","Such a silky smooth beer.  Feel is def 5 everything else is a little overhyped.  This was B2 and I got the coffee roastiness and bitterness on the backend, but was way more maple forward then I was expecting after having B1 at EBF 14.   Good beer but I still think I like the taste and smell of GM a little better."
"Mornin' Delight","B3 MD 2016.  "
"Mornin' Delight","Solid Offering really enjoyed it."
"Mornin' Delight","Updated to 2017's b4 - thick and chewy, smell of ""chocolate chip pancakes"" like they say...much more explosive maple flavor (to me) than b3 but still held back by slightly over bitter coffee on the back end."
"Mornin' Delight","Dark, coffee, maple. Don't drink to cold and it's pretty good."
"Mornin' Delight","MD B3 (2016)"
"Mornin' Delight","Batch 1 at the assassin/kbbs release."
"Mornin' Delight","Pour in my nice new MD Teku glass on MD day 2016."
"Mornin' Delight","10 oz pour in MD teku at MD day. Definitely need to let this warm up, dark oily color with a dark brown head. Aroma is very coffee forward with some syrup notes. You get the coffee first with a little syrup jumping in at the end with a great fluffy body that I was expecting. Totally nitpicking but I fell the coffee was overpowering the maple, maybe with some time the bottles will be more even?"
"Mornin' Delight","Pours black with a fleeting minimal mocha head.  The BA depiction was a mirror image of my pour, low carbonation.  "
"Mornin' Delight","L - This is a really dark beer. Thick and syrupy, sticks to the edges of the glass."
"Mornin' Delight","What a treat to try this at MD 2016. Waiting for my Teku and poor was salivating...the look as it came out of the tap was beautiful. The head was an amazing dark brown. "
"Mornin' Delight","Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight"
"Mornin' Delight","Strong Maple Flavored, almost a charred, woody Maple flavor to me. The coffee still present after so long, but had a somewhat bitter taste to it. It was a definite must have on my list, and glad it got to enjoy it. Worth the hype, probably not, but a good overall beer I'd like to try fresh one day."
"Mornin' Delight","Was rated based on Batch 2 draft "
"Mornin' Delight","Pours syrupy and has little to no head. This may not bother other people, but this a non barrel aged coffee stout. Just give me a finger nail of head. Hmm. Moving on."
"Mornin' Delight","Very excited to get to try this. Pours like syrup or motar oil with no head. Smell is huge coffee and maple. Taste is off however with a great up front coffee and burnt sugar taste that finished with a lingering sour milk flavor. This off tone dies down intensity as the beer warms but is still present. I really wanted this beer to live up to the hype but it fell short. Not even in the sane league as MBP."
"Mornin' Delight","Tried sample pour at Huna day. Friendly folks, those TG brewers."
"Mornin' Delight","On my first visit to Decorah, we biked the difficult Trout Run Trail and then headed to TG for some liquid relief. I was quite 'delighted' to find both King Sue and this on tap! "
"Mornin' Delight","Had it at Great Taste of the Midwest. It was good but does not live up to the hype."
"Mornin' Delight","First of all I can't believe this isn't barrel aged.  It smells so amazing.  Huge maple syrup smell but it goes perfect and doesn't make you think it will be too sweet.  In the glass it has an amazing body and the perfect thickness.  The taste goes perfect with the smell the coffee, the maple.  One of the best beers I've ever had.  A true pleasure to drink."
"Mornin' Delight","'15 bomber, courtesy of the ever-generous Adam - thanks again!!! Reviewed from notes; enjoyed 1/29/16."
"Mornin' Delight","I had this beer on 23rd of July '16 and I have to say that it was past its prime. The coffee wasn't really there anymore. The rest of the flavors were though. Still a good beer, but not worth the hype of this moment."
"Mornin' Delight","Have had three times, I think all the same batch. The first time it was thin and not flavorful. The second time it was of proper thickness, but not very thick, and had very good flavor. The third time it smelled strongly of spicy  coconut milk curry, but tasted good still, with well done coffee and maple notes and good mouthfeel."
"Mornin' Delight","Amazing pitch black color, thick, stains the glass and even sustains a one finger head for a while. Aroma was inconsistent throughout the glass. Sometimes I got a blast of rich coffee with some maple. At other times the coffee was subdued and maple non-existent. Dark fruit is prominent as well. Taste was a let down. Chocolate cake and cocoa are prominent. Coffee is there, but pales in comparison to the richness of the Dos Brunch I had recently. Maple isn't apparent either, but it's well integrated and produces a tiramisu like sweetness. There is a distinct cherry note, possibly from the coffee and burnt roasted malt. The mouth feel is excellent. It could be thicker, but it's still full bodied and smooth. Overall, this is an excellent non-barrel aged stout. It's right up there with Zhukov, Speedway variants, and the lesser Huna vintages. No way is it worth the hype or the price it commands on the trade market."
"Mornin' Delight","Weird vegetal note on the nose from the coffee, light metallic note on the finish. Side by side with MBP I can't enjoy this. Maple and coffee is great here but it doesn't compare well."
"Mornin' Delight","Assassins little...but not by much...brother.  Smooth and full. Toppling knows how to make big beers!"
"Mornin' Delight","I think"
"Mornin' Delight","This was great, expected more though."
"Mornin' Delight","I had batch 2. Was one of the best beers I have had. We had it side by side with Good morning. Although Mornin Delight was slightly better then Good Morning the price of admission might be a little high compared to its slightly inferior counterpart. I got a little more maple from good morning but way more explosive coffee from the Mornin Delight. Definitely a great beer but not sure I would give up what it is commanding these days!"
"Mornin' Delight","Shared with my good buddy Chris K. Split the bottle between the two of us. The initial poor is jet black and thick. No real head forms even with an aggressive poor. Nice strength to the aroma which for me was mostly maple and some coffee. The flavor is a maple bomb but there is distinct and almost separate coffee flavor which stands alone as if trying two different beers at he same time with blending them. For me it was a very simple beer with perfectly applied adjunct flavors. I wonder what will happen with this beer over time but I wasn't going to find out. A must have beer."
"Mornin' Delight","Rich maple, chocolate on nose but the coffee smell is a bit stale.  Lots of maple and chocolate, good coffee but a slight tartness underlying.  Very good beer but doesn't live up to the hype due to the hype being so high."
"Mornin' Delight","3-5oz pours on draft at the Taproom 5/5/2016"
"Mornin' Delight","Finally got to have this beer it's been one of my main ISO for years. The best beer I have ever had, so mapley, with loads of coffee. This is my new favorite I swear I came a little during my first sip. Do what you need to do to get it."
"Mornin' Delight","Was graced with this gem-of-a-beers' presence at the Ale Cheeser event in the TG taproom April 9th, 2016. It has always been a dream to give this beer a try, and needless to say, I was NOT let down by the experience."
"Mornin' Delight","Mouthfeel is very thick. Like nothing I've ever had before. The boil for this must be 18-24 hours and a 36 hour brew day total. The coffee is perfectly there, little carb, which is great IMO. Not transparent, even when you tip your glass. The legs fall down the glass slowly. The aroma is a nice sweet coffee + maple mix with roasted undertones of mellowed out fruits. Forget the penny taste, some people don't know what they're talking about. The only thing that could make this better is barrel aging. Hello Kentucky Brunch!"
"Mornin' Delight","Appearance - Pours a pitch black with a dark mocha brown head. The head isn't large and the retention is short, but the lacing isn't bad."
"Mornin' Delight","2015 bottle.  Best beer ive ever had.  Period.  End of discussion.  Pours the blackest black.  No head whatsoever.  Smells like pancakes and coffee.  Tastes of pancakes and coffee.  Maple notes come out more as the beer heats. Have one bottle left and dont know what will be an accomplishment good enough to crack it open.  G.O.A.T."
"Mornin' Delight","Batch 2 - Honestly unreal. Worth the hype. Worth the hunt. Find it however you can. It's absolutely mind-blowing. Super dark. Super rich. When the bottle is empty, you will cry, because you may never see it again. Amazing, amazing, amazing."
"Mornin' Delight","So much maple you could use this as pancake syrup. This is one incredible brew.. Heavy aroma of maple and coffee dark mocha thick head that coats the glass as you swirl it around. A bit on the sweeter Side from all the maple and sugar used a whole bottle may spike your chances for diabetes lol."
"Mornin' Delight","Not that big mouthfeel that Assassin, SR71 and KBBS have, but the flavor was as promised. Aside from other TG stouts, this was phenomenal. Big thick with huge amount of coffee and a nice amount of maple."
"Mornin' Delight","this was a banger i was finally able to try. my only gripe is that, yes, i want to try this again, but no, i would never pay what people ask for it. for a non barrel aged beer, i put this next to, but not above hunahpu. the coffee is noticeable, and the beer is thick and drinkable. the one adjective i kept going back to was, smooth."
"Mornin' Delight","Huna day 2016. Props to TG for bringing enough for me to get to try it even later in the day."
"Mornin' Delight","Huna Day, 2016"
"Mornin' Delight","Lucky enough to kick off HunaDay16 with this highly sought after beer. This beer did not live up to the hype in my opinion. Excellent aroma with heavy coffee notes, but the body felt incredibly thin for the style. "
"Mornin' Delight","Had at hunahpu day 2016. Definitely a tasty beer but wasn't the best at the festival. Compared to its peers, I would prefer to have good morning from tree house 10 times out of 10."
"Mornin' Delight","Pours a motor oil black color with mocha brown head. Aroma is coffee chocolate and maple syrup. Flavor follow the nose and is really well balanced. Has a lingering aftertaste of maple and coffee. Big body and oveRall delicious"
"Mornin' Delight","Draft. Pours oily black with a creamy brown head. Lots of ashy roast in the aroma, some dark chocolate, cocoa. Big sweet flavour, which clashes somewhat with a hard ashy aspect. There is also a lot of espresso and scorched earth. Full bodied, oily and chewy, with fine carbonation. Bitter finish with more baking cocoa, scorched earth, strong roast. A very good beer overall."
"Mornin' Delight","No where near as good as Good Morning or even CBS.  The maple is definitely there up front, but it fades very quickly, almost tasting artificial, IMO.  The finish is all coffee, no maple.  Very good, but not quite elite to me."
"Mornin' Delight","This is a very solid stout(coffee aside) if you base on the stout, its good, Its clearly has a good base, it dark and creamy. While the morning delight is more of second runnings of this beer. I am not a very huge coffee fan and so i cant give it a 5 on taste. that being said it a must try for everyone"
"Mornin' Delight","Meh...  this is the most over rated beer I've ever had.  Black as night, moderate thickness, chocolate And cocoa powder, this is fair but this does not live up to the hype and there are better shelf beers out there."
"Mornin' Delight","L: Intense opaque dark chocolate hues with a thin 5mm sandy cinnamon head; exceedingly transitional lacing with minimal retention - visually this is my ideal for an imperial stout"
"Mornin' Delight","Finally got the chance to try this one thanks to DJ (happy birthday!)."
"Mornin' Delight","Had this beer on tap at the J Wakefield First Anniversary Party (Wakestock).  The look is chocolate.  Another reviewer said it looks like a Willy Wonka Chocolate River.  They were right, but it's definitely more viscous.  Smells nice and chocolatey but I was hoping for a little more aroma.  Taste is sweet chocolate with smooth tasting coffee and a bit of maple.  The maple is not the major player here but is definitely noticeable.  The mouthfeel is top notch with a smooth,  creamy, easy drinking well hidden abv experience.  Overall a great stout.  My only small criticism is that it's a little bit too sweet."
"Mornin' Delight","Big thanks to @GarMerr for sharing this bottle on Super Bowl Sunday.  Incredibly viscous - pour looks like Willy Wonka's chocolate river lusciously flowing from the bottle to glass.  Aroma is incredible - like walking into your favorite cozy coffee shop that just had the most amazing maple syrup spilled all over the floor.  Taste follows the aroma, and I found it to be best when taking small sips.  Thankfully TG seems to bring a keg of this beer to numerous events throughout the year - can't wait to try it again!"
"Mornin' Delight","Definitely a top want in the stout game...and it was darn tasty. On draft at Rate Beer Best - thick syrup like, huge chocolate, coffee, plum and Roasty notes mixed with sweet sugar and some alcohol hotness. A bomb of a beer for sure...would do well with a few years of age."
"Mornin' Delight","Wow, where to begin. First of all, the wax on this bottle is beautiful and it is a great start of what will follow. "
"Mornin' Delight","Truly excellent beer.  Goes splendid with sausage pinwheels!"
"Mornin' Delight","Let me start off by saying, I am reviewing this a couple weeks after I had it, so I won't be as descriptive as I'd like to be. "
"Mornin' Delight","What can I say...this is along with BAVDL and Triple Sunshine are my 3 favorite beers ever...there is no reason to not give this beer 5s across the board...thick motor oil pour with a dark brown head...smell and taste are like like espresso with maple syrup thrown in...just sweet enough..everything plays in perfectly...mouthfeel is a huge winner here as well...perfect syrupy body to it...my first maple coffee stout and unfortunately I don't see my experience with this format getting any better than this"
"Mornin' Delight","Save yourself the heartburn and get morning wood from funky Buddha. It's nearly as good. "
"Mornin' Delight","As much as I respect opinions of others, I question anybody who doesn't give this beer a 5 across the board!"
"Mornin' Delight","Pours a dark black from the bottle. Nose is intense sweet maple syrup. It smells like breakfast with a little bit of coffee coming through at the end. The body is medium sweet maple syrup with a balanced coffee coming in and  out. You could seriously put this on some pancakes or sausage links. Mouth feel was smooth and low carb making an excellent sipper. Hype justified and glad I was able to try some!"
"Mornin' Delight","Wow. Phenomenal beer. Complex and smooth at the same time."
"Mornin' Delight","Mornin delight batch 2"
"Mornin' Delight","L: Creamy, dark-brown with caramel head"
"Mornin' Delight","2015 vintage. This was a very impressive beer, but given the insanely high ratings I was maybe expecting something a little more. Great balance of maple and coffee."
"Mornin' Delight","Poured from a 22oz bottle received from the very generous RyanJohnCrain.  Thanks Ryan!  Consumed over Thanksgiving.  Aroma hit me from a few feet away and instantly made me think of chocolate chip pancakes.  No clue why.  I've never had them or seen them before...but that's what this beer smells like.   Taste is delicious, and you get a nice balance of chocolate, maple and coffee.  However, not as much maple as I would have thought, and it doesn't have quite the same degree of fudgey maple taste as Good Morning does.  I had 2-week old GM a week later and thought it was a noticeable notch above this.  However, unlike some people on here, I'm not trying to make a huge political point here by pointing out how this beer could've been better, so while not perfect, it still gets good scores.  Anyone giving this beer below a 4 either has no appreciation for this style at all, or is simply trying to skew the ratings b/c they've concluded it's overhyped."
"Mornin' Delight","2015 vintage. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a 2015 Mornin' Delight tulip glass. Acquired in a trade with PaulG, thank you very much. Opened in celebration of my marriage. Drank over the course of ~1.5 hours, allowed to warm over that time. "
"Mornin' Delight","Sampled from bottle of 2015 batch. Somehow, this lived up to the considerable hype. Very drinkable at 12%. The various flavors are balanced perfectly, with maple syrup front and center. I think I like this better than KBBS."
"Mornin' Delight","It's a good beer.  Worth the hype?  I don't think so.  Lots of coffee. Maple on the finish.  Mouthfeel is fantastic."
"Mornin' Delight","Love, love, love this.   Had it last night on tap at Reds ale house.  Nice blend of coffee and Maple.   Smells like a short attack of flap Jacks.   Where are my eggs and two strips of bacon."
"Mornin' Delight","wow, thanks Paulie! never thought I would get to try this and it exceeded my expectations. shared a 22oz bottle with my buddy and it was just maple coffee stout delicipusness. really a revaluation and fully worth the cost of admission. one of the best beers I have ever had. I feel extremely fortunate to have had an 11oz pour of this"
"Mornin' Delight","22oz bottle from the recent release split 7 ways"
"Mornin' Delight","Okay so before rating this beer I must say that this is by far amongst the top OVER RATED beers on here.  The spot that it claims on the top 250 list is ridiculous.  I don't think this is a bad beer at all, just why so high.  This beer is my 1,620th beer I've ever had. Maybe the people rating haven't had enough to know what a good beer tastes like? or just fan boys pushing value higher and higher to claim ultimate whaley status. "
"Mornin' Delight","Maybe it was the hype, but I was underwhelmed. Good coffee presence but a bit light on the maple. Was hoping for a more decadent stout and was a bit thinner than I expected. Glad I got to try it but not worth the cost or effort to get again."
"Mornin' Delight","Amazing beer!"
"Mornin' Delight","The best beer Halloween to date!"
"Mornin' Delight","Tastes like chocolate chip pancakes soaked in maple syrup and booze. Rich, thick, and super smooth."
"Mornin' Delight","This has way too much coffee and not enough maple for me.  Good Morning has a lot more flavor.   I was expecting a maple bomb and I was sort of disappointed."
"Mornin' Delight","Poured from a bomber into a snifter."
"Mornin' Delight","Not sure how I feel about this one. 2015 bottle. Tan head. Black color. "
"Mornin' Delight","2015 version in a 22oz bottle. Initially the nose/taste was more coffee forward but as it warmed up in the glass more maple syrup started to show in both the nose and the taste.  I was expecting it to be thicker so I had to bump it down some.  Excellent beer, but not exactly what I heard from so many people regarding the previous batch in terms of mouthfeel mostly."
"Mornin' Delight","lives up to the hype.  had next to SR-71, Assassin and KBBS the next day and MD was up with KBBS in my book"
"Mornin' Delight","This was Exxon Valdez thick with a lovely waft -- maple syrup and chocolate. Superb mouthfeel and big for a non BA stout. Really nice variation between chocolate, maple and coffee. Coffee and cream flavor predominates. The only major flaw is a bitterness on the finish that appears left over from the coffee. Excellent, but not quite at the very top of my list for an Imperial Stout. A tad overhyped."
"Mornin' Delight","Call it homerism, but this beer is an absolute heavy hitter and worth every penny for the price of admission. You get a huge boom of maple and chocolate as soon as you crack the bottle open. It is hard to believe that this beer isn't barrel aged by how much flavor they seem to pack into the bottle. The pour is, of course, motor oil thick and it sticks to the glass like it never wants to slide back down. I think the only thing I can say against it is that it is such a big beer and you need to share it with your friends. If you don't have friends, find some strangers. This beer will put any soul brave to slay it down to his knees like Ahab on on the starboard side of his catatonic vessel. Approach with caution, thar whale be fierce in its might and ready to do the Wakey Wakey Eggs and Bakey tango with your tastebuds, bud."
"Mornin' Delight","Absolute maple bomb.  I haven't tried Good Morning yet, but so far, this has to be my favorite maple stout/porter (over the likes of CBS, Beyond Good & Evil, BB Black Maple, etc).  Also the best smelling stout I've ever had... worthy of the hype, for sure."
"Mornin' Delight","An absolutely wonderful beer, but maybe not as good as the hype. Doesn't smell very good. Body and mouthfeel are perfect. Great roasty maple and coffee. Bigger and less sweet than Good Morning, but overall it's a toss up."
"Mornin' Delight","Outstanding beer. Extremely thick and viscous. A huge amount of coffee, dark chocolate, and to a lesser extent; maple syrup. I've had KBBS and this isnt quite as good to me but still better than any other beer I've had. My only reason for docking it would be not enough maple flavor, which isnt much of a fault in my book."
"Mornin' Delight","UPDATE 10/26. Had a chance to try this again and during the day this time, side by side with Tree House Good Morning 8/20 batch. The pour was in fact so viscous in the light that rivals SR71. Mouthfeel this time was incredible, significantly thicker than GM and not as sweet as GM. It has become my favorite non-BA maple coffee beer of all-time. Upping my rating to 5/5. "
"Mornin' Delight","L - Very dark brew.  Lightish brown head with good carbination.  "
"Mornin' Delight","For my tastes, superior to KBBS, SR71, and Assassin. Appearance is spot on; opaque, viscous, black with dark brown accents, an espresso like head of brown shot through with amber / mahogany tones. Ring of brown foam clings to the edges of the glass. Aroma is a blast of maple and coffee, a bitter roast note at the end. A bit one dimensional though; I like a bit more malt presence and the adjuncts obscure it. The flavor, though, brings back the roasty malts, chicory and charred oak impressions though not barrel aged, maple pecan / praline flavors. The one criticism I have is it's a pretty straight forward coffee profile. It simply says ""coffee"" and I feel like you could get more nuance from a more studied application. There's no risk involved in this coffee choice. Feel is close to perfect - chewy but not as coating as the BA versions that really overwhelm you."
"Mornin' Delight","I don't normally write reviews but WOW! "
"Mornin' Delight","L: Jet black. Deep tan head, light carbonation."
"Mornin' Delight","If you could have a Hot-Chocolate/Coffee kind of beer this would be it. Great, great beer. Had it on tap and have been craving it since. Smells of sugar and maple, roasty coffee, boozey chocolates.  Viscous mouth feel, thick and chewy that just coats your mouth. Solid!"
"Mornin' Delight","Real deal, had to acquire another bottle to confirm. Mouthfeel is unreal, maple syrup and coffee everywhere but not excessively sweet. Sort of happy it is not barrel-aged..."
"Mornin' Delight","Bottle from the source. Consumed at room temperature."
"Mornin' Delight","This isn't a beer. There's no way that this is a beer. Sorry, I don't believe it. This is so much more than a beer! This is an experience! This takes stouts/beer to a whole new level! This is out of this world! "
"Mornin' Delight","Had on tap at the source during MD release."
"Mornin' Delight","2015 release party pour(s).  "
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Dexter's in Madison and at Toppling Goliath at release."
"Mornin' Delight","2015 vintage at the 8/29/2015 release on draft"
"Mornin' Delight","Poured into a 6 oz tulip glass - Thanks so much for sharing Nathan!"
"Mornin' Delight","The nose is incredible. The freshest roast of coffee amalgamated perfectly with sweet and dark chocolate to balance the bitterness of the roast. The taste supersedes the nose if one can believe that. A lot of coffee stouts albeit good... tend to portray a roasted bitterness, which I do not mind necessarily, but Morning Delight goes beyond the realm of balance. The real player in this beer is their signature soft and pillowy mouthfeel, similar to Treehouse GM, but a bit more viscous due to the ABV.  This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had. I had it next to Morning Delight, which is just as good, if not better, but lighter and sweeter. These are both perfect."
"Mornin' Delight","This is a good coffee stout. not worth the hype ... feel like a lot of people are just reviewing this high so they can use it as trade bate...                                           "
"Mornin' Delight","2015 bomber poured into a snifter.  Tasted following Tree House Good Morning."
"Mornin' Delight","Had some of this at the release (8/29/15) and someone was nice enough to open one during a bottle share last night. "
"Mornin' Delight","Absolutely incredible. Had on tap at release. So much maple and coffee. Very little heat.  You could drink a bottle of it so quickly as it goes down incredibly smooth."
"Mornin' Delight","Let me preface, I don't give many perfect scores out, but this is just ridiculous stuff.  "
"Mornin' Delight","Draft at the brewery bottle release on 8/29/15"
"Mornin' Delight","Had this on tap at the release party 8/29/2015. Poured very dark and thick with a small amount of head. The smell of this beer is amazing, I got a good amount of coffee and a slight maple smell as well.  The smell changes a fair amount as the beer warmed up a little as well. The taste of this beer is amazing! So much coffee and maple flavor but it doesn't overpower the base. Very good mouth feel as well, nice and thick and chewy. "
"Mornin' Delight","On draft at the brewery bottle release 8/29/15"
"Mornin' Delight","Favorite beer of our girls share. Love breakfast food and coffee, so no surprise there. This is brunch in a bottle for me and my girls. Gorgeous black coffee look with amazing maple coffee nose, maple doesn't come through as much as the coffee. Huge maple and chocolately coffee taste and amazing mouthfeel, I haven't had a more pleasurable feel in a beer, thick and sticky like maple syrup. Overall amazing."
"Mornin' Delight","Really, really dig this beer. As close to perfect as it gets for an adjunct stout with coffee. The only area the beer lacks in is the maple nose -- not to say there isn't a significant amount there, there is -- but the maple could be more pronounced, the coffee overcomes it.  As far as taste, the maple and coffee are both huge.  I have no idea how Mike manages to get this much maple in the beer.  Mouthfeel is perfect, nice thick and hearty feeling breakfast beer."
"Mornin' Delight","I had the pleasure of trying this and Good Morning last weekend at the Mornin' Delight release in Decorah, IA. It's just a massive punch of coffee and chocolate chip pancakes. Is there a better combination in beer than maple syrup and coffee? And when it is done right there is not much that can beat it. It is the perfect breakfast beer. Lives up to the hype."
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Toppling Goliath during the 2015 release."
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Toppling Goliath for the Mornin' Delight release party! "
"Mornin' Delight","Overall a pretty much perfect maple/coffee stout"
"Mornin' Delight","This was my first time trying Md during the release. Prior to the release, I opened my bcbs 2014/13 and Kbs 15/12 and bcbs vr 2014 to remind myself of what goodness should be. And MD was up there with VR. The aroma/taste reminded me of slow drip coffee from single origin coffee beans blended perfect with maple syrup. The body was perfect as it had a fuller month feel than a Kbs but not as full as a VR."
"Mornin' Delight","Had on tap during the release at Toppling Goliath. Served in a 12oz snifter. Initial smell was like a punch to the face of pure maple. Body is very full and complex. Dark as night in color. This beer has legs and is very sticky on the glass. The more this warms up, the more complex the maple character gets"
"Mornin' Delight","Had this on tap at the release at Toppling Goliath. "
"Mornin' Delight","Had it on tap at the TG release on Saturday 8/29/15. "
"Mornin' Delight","Had at the 2015 release.  Extremely dark beer, pitch black with a tan head. The beer is so thick that it coated the glass dying it a light brown. Coats every part of your mouth too."
"Mornin' Delight","Simply a delight"
"Mornin' Delight","Yesterday at the 2015 release.  First review on BA."
"Mornin' Delight","I had this yesterday at the 2015 release. "
"Mornin' Delight","If I could give the smell higher than a 5 I would.  2015 version brewed with maple syrup.  HOLY H*ll.  AMAZING worth the hype and 3 hour drive!"
"Mornin' Delight","10 Oz pour at TG yesterday into the MD chalice. Thanks again to the Hop Partol and Clark for running a fantastic release. Here's the notes. "
"Mornin' Delight","10oz pour from the 2015 Mornin' Delight release (10:30AM)."
"Mornin' Delight","Thick, chewy, tasty but overhyped"
"Mornin' Delight","From the 2015 release. Very dark chocolate color with a nice lace.  Tried it chilled right out of the keg then let it warm up for 10-15 minutes.  The flavor and aroma really came out after it warmed up. Very strong smell off coffee and maple but not over powering. One could barely tell this was 12% ABV until the slight buzz started to set in. This beer was delicious and by far the best stout I've ever had."
"Mornin' Delight","How can this beer be 12%?  Soooo smooth.   Rich, thick,  sweet (but not too much).  Coffee roast leads the way followed by the maple sweetness.   And that aroma is AMAZING.  Go get this one if you got the fire power to do so."
"Mornin' Delight","Batch 2 at MD release on tap. So thick and black it coats the glass as you swirl it. More head than I was expecting that is a deep caramel color. The aroma is a bomb of maple and coffee. It tastes like a glass of creamy coffee with tons of syrup poured in. The beer is almost chewy and coats your mouth and teeth. Truly spectacular and lives up to the hype."
"Mornin' Delight","Rating the 2015 release. What an exceptional beer. The smell is a strong maple, with the head being similar to the color of maple syrup, maybe a bit lighter. Absolutely packed with coffee and maple. By far the best imperial stout I've ever had. No noticable alcohol bite for being such a high ABV. This is incredibly smooth. Quite the treat!"
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Dexters during Great Taste Eve. Big thick black body. Huge aroma of coffee. Slick sticky mouthfeel. Hell, this beer is very sticky. Taste was huge coffee. Can’t understate how much coffee flavor is in there. Probably more than the average extra dark roast coffee from the local coffee cafe. Has lots of sweet maple flavor to cut through the coffee. One thing I didn’t like was that is was kind of tart. This might have been the coffee though. Still, I didn’t care for the tart taste."
"Mornin' Delight","Waited in line to drink this and SR-71 at Dexters in Madison. Having some Morning Delight at 9AM with free donuts was a great experience. The appearance was pitch black with barley no head.. did you see what I did their.  Smell was rich dark and sweet. Tasted like heaven! maple, coffee, chocolate, nice barrel flavor, with a hint of booze near the end. Full mouth coating, It was the perfect beer to  drink with donuts. Overall I loved this beer and I am super happy to get invited into the release party on the 29th this month."
"Mornin' Delight","Had at Great Taste of the Midwest, Wow is all I can say..."
"Mornin' Delight","2015 batch on draft at Dexter's in Madison.  Dark and brooding with a strong maple/coffee nose.  You can tell it is thick just by the lag as you swirl it.  Taste is maple and sweet up front with a strong, slightly bitter coffee finish that lingers.  Super thick and chewy.  The maple smell stays in the glass for days afterward.  One of the best stouts I've ever had.  If you don't like coffee or sweet in your stouts, this  may not be your thing, but definitely worth the experience!"
"Mornin' Delight","Beasty looking beer, jet black with a minimal head of dark brown. Strong coffee aroma complimented by rich maple, bitter dark chocolate, and vanilla sweetness to even it out.  Probably the richest flavor and texture I've ever experienced. The maple and vanilla came together seamlessly with fresh coffee grounds being potent without dominating the beer. Lips literally stuck together after each savory sip. A treat to try it at Dexter's at a very orderly event."
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Dexter's in Madison (Aug '15). Delicious mix of coffee and maple without either being overpowering. Thick mouthfeel, full bodied, huge maple syrup notes, sticky but not overly sweet. Lives up to the hype and well worth seeking out."
"Mornin' Delight","Taste: sweet maple, malty, Espresso coffee bean, rich chocolate notes."
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Dexter's. Very intense battle going on between coffee and maple with each sip. Coffee flavor was very strong but then with the next sip maple would overpower. Very enjoyable to drink. My only complaint is that I wish it was creamier with a thicker feel. Having sampled sr-71 I felt like MD was a little thin."
"Mornin' Delight","I'll start out by saying that I am not a coffee drinker/lover by any stretch of the imagination.  That being said, this beer was freaking amazing.  Great coffee nose (I don't mind the smell of coffee) with some slight sweetness in the taste along with some coffee and chocolate.  Had it on tap at Dexter's in Madison today and it was worth the wait.  Wasn't sure I'd ever have this and it lived up to the hype."
"Mornin' Delight","Flavors of dark chocolate, coffee liqueur and boozy molasses."
"Mornin' Delight","Not much on the nose, but a hint of sweetness.  A lot of coffee on the taste, but by no means overpowering.  The coffee blends well with a slightly sweetness. The finish is decently full but a bitterness bite that comes in on the end.  Overall very good, but not otherworldly."
"Mornin' Delight","'13 Mornin' Delight from the bottle still drinking great two years out."
"Mornin' Delight","Had it on tap at the TG release on Saturday 8/29/15. The look is just what you'd expect from a TG stout, amazing. SUPER GREAT MOUTH FEEL!!!The head is minimal and presents a deep tan color. The way this beer coats the glass is like no other beer I've seen. The entire glass is coated in sweet maple stout by the time you're through. The smell is very coffee forward but you begin to pick up the maple as it warms. In my opinion this is the only area where this beer slightly lacked. We had Good Morning the Friday before and the nose on that beer had a lot more maple. But once MD warms up a bit, it honestly smelled like pancakes... The taste...heavenly. You get a bunch of coffee upfront and subtle maple notes towards the end. Once you let this bad boy warm up for a bit, it completely changes the complexity of the beer. The maple becomes much more pronounced. They say to drink fresh, I'm not saying to age it for two years...but I feel six months to a year will only add to the character of this stout. The feel of the beer is hands down one of the best I've had. It's super thick and viscious, leaves almost a resin type feel in the back of your throat. This is where MD blows GM out the water. Again we had GM the evening prior, and everyone agreed it was a great tasting beer. But after having MD, it was a unamious vote for Toppling Goliath. Overall, this was the best non-BA stout I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Frankly I never write reviews, if I do, they're typically a few sentences long. I'm not one to over-hype a particular beer, but I'd definitely put this in my top 5...maybe top 3 best beers I've ever had. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a big fan of maple coffee stouts. But you will not be disappointed. I had every intention on trading one of these bad boys prior to the release...after having it, I don't think I could trade for another beer (despite KBBS) that would be on the same level as this. TG keep doing what you're doing. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this amazing beer. BEST STOUT I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!"
"Mornin' Delight","This is the best beer I have ever had."
"Mornin' Delight","Look: Dark brown foam on a pitch black body, leaves an excellent dark brown lacing on the glass. Very enticing."
"Mornin' Delight","This stout is the epitome of perfection.  Thick mouthfeel, full bodied, tons of maple syrup.. and very complex.  By far the best stout I've ever had.  Beats out KBBS and Assassin."
"Mornin' Delight","Served on draught into a MD Snifter on release day. Consumed over 2.5 hours to allow the beer to warm to ambient temperature. "
"Mornin' Delight","My favorite to date!  of that style.  btw.  Soo smooth its almost unbelieveable.  Great Job TG!  Had this for my big 4 0!  Keeps getting better!"
"Mornin' Delight","KBBS is better but this is still fantastic!!!"
"Mornin' Delight","Bottle (* of 300). Huge thanks to Hopscotch for sharing this beast. Joan Jett black pour with a brown head. Huge maple syrup aromas. It truly is breakfast in a glass. Maple syrup, black coffee, dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate. Great mouthfeel and body. Impressive..."
"Mornin' Delight","2013 bottle #57/300 shared on 8/26/14 with some fellow BAs"
"Mornin' Delight","Review is from a 2015 bottle.  Incredible, thick mouthfeel.  Literally sticky.  Nose heavy on coffee and maple.  Taste is coffee forward, with just the right amount of maple and dry chocolate.  Despite the prominent maple, not as as sweet as Assassin or SR-71.  Just outstanding--best coffee stout I've ever tried."
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at the 2014 GToM. "
"Mornin' Delight","Served side by side with KBBS and Assassin."
"Mornin' Delight","Was fortunate enough to receive the entire set from cparles a while back. We did this one, Assassin and KBBS in that order. Cheers! "
"Mornin' Delight","Great beer overall! Has a dark/mahogany pour with a tan head. Dark fruits and coffee and maple aromas make up this beer with a similar taste. It also has a sweet espresso type taste with hints of bitter chocolates. Texture is very creamy! Also served on tap!"
"Mornin' Delight","The beer comes in a dark black color with a thin brown lacing."
"Mornin' Delight","Enjoyed at EBF 2014."
"Mornin' Delight","A-EBF sample. Pours thick, oily and black."
"Mornin' Delight","Poured out as an ultra black Stout, quick fading brown head, this beer has some legs on it as well. The smell has massive amounts of coffee which is enough to wake you up without even drinking it. The taste is boozy with all that coffee and deep roasted grains, plenty of flavors going on here. Overall it's an excellent beer."
"Mornin' Delight","It smells like a breakfast blend of maple, Hershey’s chocolate pancakes, and a bit of Irish coffee with cream. The taste is big and bold and smooth too, matching up perfectly with the welcoming aroma and the dollop dropping body. Flavors include milk chocolate, coffee, well-incorporated maple syrup sweetness and just some toffee. There’s something additional here too, a doughy cookie batter chewiness, that sets it apart from other stouts that have those traditional coffee-milk-chocolate aspects. Rich and smooth in body, motor oil heavy and moderately carbonated."
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at Dexter's in Madison, WI and also on tap at the Great Taste of the Midwest. "
"Mornin' Delight","On tap at TG served in a Chalice"
"Mornin' Delight","10oz pour from Mornin' Delight Chalice at 2015 release party. (Usually don't review, but this is an exception)"
"Mornin' Delight","Pour is jet black with a burnt cappuccino head. Nose is a bit greener than kbbs, lots more coffee and a bit more simple. Some sugary sweetness behind. Taste is strong coffee, both are really clean coffee without any of that burnt acrid flavor. A little vanilla and marshmallow, a fair bit of malt sweetness in back but abrupt. The wood in kbbs added a lot, this gets just as sweet without the bourbon. The coffee is still really clean and nice for a coffee stout. The body is very creamy and the carb is light."

"Mornin' Delight","A - Nice dark tan head, dark brown appearance. Looks really nice."
"Mornin' Delight","Reviewing the highly sought after Morning Delight from my friends at the Toppling Goliath Brewery out of Decorah, Iowa. This mega-delicious imperial stout drinks like an imperial Canadian Breakfast Stout, and its bottle release quickly put Toppling Goliath on the radar for those who had not yet heard of them. I have had this brew a few times prior, but I felt it was time to finally write this one up now that I had a bottle of my own to sit back and enjoy"
"Mornin' Delight","Mornin' Delight, an already legendary beer from a brewery that is rapidly becoming a maker of world class beer. I have only been aware of Topping Goliath's existence for about four months but they are already one of my favorite breweries as everything I try from them has been excellent. I can add Mornin' Delight to that list after trying it at The Great Taste of the Midwest this past weekend. I can't say that I loved it as much as some people do but it is an interesting beer that you shouldn't need much more than a few ounces to get your fill because of it's thick texture and sweet taste. "
"Mornin' Delight","From a growler in a glass @ mwbbf"
"Mornin' Delight","I've been fortunate to try a lot of good beers. I've never rated one 5s across the board. What a delicious beer. Nice work Toppling Goliath! Rich thick black opaque deliciousness. It pours with a nice dark chocolate head that quickly dissipates. The smell and taste pour out wave after wave of rich chocolate, dark coffee, and roasted malt. There's enough of a boozy backbone to keep it from being cloying. This was a real treat to drink."
"Mornin' Delight","Had on tap at the KBBS release."
"Mornin' Delight","12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. "
"Mornin' Delight","Had on tap at TG Assassin/Morning Delight release in a 12ounce chalice. My new favorite beer, lots of coffee but not overwhelming. Thick fantastic mouthfeel and just bursting with breakfast flavors, maple, etc. Dark blackish brown color and the smell is similar to the taste."
"Mornin' Delight","Graciously shared by IPeeA. This beer blew my mind. As a coffee lover I'm often looking for more coffee flavor in my stout. This was by far the most coffee I've ever found in a double stout. Over the top. Might have liked this even better than their Kentucky Brunch - both are 5's."
"Mornin' Delight","12oz waxed and capped bottle into a snifter. Shared by Josh! Reviewed from notes. "
"Mornin' Delight","Beer Nirvana. The mother beer for Kentucky brunch is a big mother. Chewy and big as it should be. Wish I had had another pint before it ran out. My compliments to Clark and company for their commitment to small batches and great brews. Cant wait for the next release"
"Mornin' Delight","Had on tap Friday evening , day before the K-Brunch release, which, by the way, was one of the best run beer releases I have ever been to, and I've been to most of the ""biggies"". "
"Mornin' Delight","I've never had enough CBS to give it a full review. I have had enough, however--at festivals and tastings and other places where tiny pours are given--to know that it's not worth the exorbident price it goes for on the trade market. It's a very good beer, yes, but... man, when I heard about a barrel aged syrup beer, I had a certain idea in mind. I wanted it to taste like a combination of the way an RIS tastes and the way a plate of breakfast smells right when it's placed down in front of you. CBS didn't deliver on my fantastic desire. And that's not it's fault. No beer could. "
"Mornin' Delight","A: black. Pours with a visible viscosity. Almost syrup like. Doesn't form much of. Head, but it does form a bit of extremely dark mocha crema head. No lacing. "
"Mornin' Delight","I had a sample of this at Dark Lord Day, but recently had a chance to sit down with a good-sized pour and take some detailed notes. Bottle #178/300. Served in a Wakefield Brewing snifter."
"Mornin' Delight","This beer was awesome... it's a shame the bottles are so small, while perfect for single serving, they are hard to share or put down. Thanks to Ted for sharing a few of these over the weekend."
"Mornin' Delight","Bottle (2013)"
"Mornin' Delight","Huge thanks to Eli for bringing this bottle to the tasting last night. Can't remember the bottle number off the top of my head."
"Mornin' Delight","bottle 258 out of 300. Vintage 2013."
"Mornin' Delight","I wanted to try it at GTMW this past summer but it was gone within minutes of being tapped. Hand numbered and signed bottle, shared with friends."
"Mornin' Delight","This beer is very thick and viscous  with aromas of coffee  and maple syrup."
"Mornin' Delight","Generously shared by several strangers at DLD '13. Thanks, generous strangers!"
"Mornin' Delight","A: As always, Toppling Goliath has excellent labels for their beer. Poured into my tulip it seems thicker than other stouts and the head is minimal. When I look at the bottom of the bottle I can see what looks like thick syrupy residue left behind."
"Mornin' Delight","I've never reviewed a beer on BA before, and this seems as good a time as any to start! Received this bronze-waxed beauty last week, and it's been sitting in our fridge and enticing me every since! I will preface this by saying that I love Toppling Goliath and everything they've done so far, and I believe they are one of two or three breweries to watch in the Midwest over the next couple years. So, here goes:"
"Mornin' Delight","huge thanks to hopazoid for trading this beer!"
"Mornin' Delight","Haven't done a review in a long time but I feel compelled after tasting this one."
"Mornin' Delight","On tap into a tulip shaped glass:"
"Mornin' Delight","I had this on-tap at the Toppling Goliath tap room. It was served in a chalice tulip. Mornin' Delight was reviewed from notes."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Huge maple aroma right out of the gate and a vicious, dark pour. Maple dominates the nose but chocolate, barrel, and some coffee see also present. The mouth feel is massive and coats the mouth for days with adequate carbonation. It all makes for an impressive experience, but the taste falls well short of world class. There is a sour note that I also found in Mornin Delight. Some reviews have described it as coffee bitterness, but that's not what I get. It tastes like an off flavor. Since I've tasted the same thing twice I'm quite sure this isn't just a bad bottle. I'm not a fan of MD and the barrel aged version doesn't cover over the flaws."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","A delight for the senses. A perfect beer."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2017 silver wax courtesy of Treyliff.  Coincidentally, this is also my 1,000th check in on BA.  "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Where do I begin? Dark, rich appearance with creamy mocha brown head. Coffee, chocolate, maple, vanilla and other notes greet the nose after opening; it takes the room! You want to enjoy this before you sip....again sip, and let it rest on the palate. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2017 release"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This beer was definitely on a different level. Everything about it was awesome."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Low carbonation, attractive, but the immediately dissipating head renders it less than perfect. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Is it overhyped? Who knows. This is the rarest beer I've ever tried, and I doubt I'll try anything like this again. Once in a lifetime experience."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 bottle shared with 2 others - 5 oz pour"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 vintage. 6 oz pour into the TG KBBS glass.  Smells like a pancake breakfast complete with a neat bourbon. This beer melts in your mouth! Fudge fudge fudge with tons of maple that fades to barrel.  Sticks around in your mouth long after you swallow.  Lives up to the hype!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Great beer, still can't believe the secondary market on this one."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","It's really hard to rate a beer like this.  For what it goes for unless it gave me an orgasm while drinking I don't think it would ever be worth it unless I got it close to face value.  That being said I will do my best reviewing it.  Had a 2.5 oz. pour of a 2106 bottle at a share.  Had side by side with some great stous including SR-71, FVM, Assassin, MBP.  This is a really phenomenal maple bomb of a beer with some crazy complexity.  Maple dominated the nose and made it a little one dimensional yet it smelled great. Thought the coffee and barrel came through in the flavor. Another great maple beer I thought that I like the taste better as it had more richness to me was 2014 Beyond Good and Evil.  The mouthfeel is out of this world though.  It's a top notch beer and I would love a chance to have the 14 as 2 guys at the share said that was the very best beer they've ever had.  On this day SR-71 stood as king in my eyes.  Is it worth the price of admission?  No, no beer is worse this much, but I understand why people are willing to pay this much and I do understand the ticker mentality as that is what drove me to try this beer."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","I am going to need to revisit all my prior ratings as this one literally does take the cake! With so much hype yet it completely lives up to it. Shared by a great beer friend, 2016 vintage into smaller taster. Nose was simply incredible, super chocolaty, slight maple sweetness and subtle barrel oak and char notes.  Thick and viscous pour and close to pitch black. Tastes likes bittersweet bakers chocolate liquefied and infused with rich sweet maple syrup. The maple is more pronounced on the tast and the barrel notes follow. Honestly could have just smelled the beer all night, simply intoxicating. Glad I got the pleasure and treat to try this from the most generous beer buddy."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Note: This review is based on the '13 vintage."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Batch 3."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","L: It pours like you might think. Black, viscous(like really, used cold engine oil thick) and next to no head. It coats like none I have ever seen."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","L: completely satins the glass."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This beer was amazing...maple fudginess in a glass--a 2 oz sample in a sampler glass. The only knock I could consider was the price on the secondary market, but as a beer itself definitely one of the best I've had!!!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 vintage, bottle #80.  Roughly 4 oz pour into a white wine glass.  The balance of maple and coffee on both the nose and taste is truly remarkable.  I can't begin to explain or understand how a beer delivering so much flavor with this level of viscosity doesn't turn into a sweet diabetes bomb.  The mouthfeel is unreal; a velvet-like texture I've never quite experienced.  "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 out of an Assassin Teku. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","I am not one to get on hype trains about beers. BUUUUTT. This beer lives up to its hype. Thick, dark, molasses type consisitency pour with little head. Smells of coffee and maple syrup. Tastes like a coffee brownie. And about as thick as one. INCREDIBLE BEER!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","From the breweries I unwaxed and unlabeled bottle."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","My girlfriend who won the TG lottery and I shared this bottle tonight for my 34th birthday. When we cracked the bottle the smell of maple syrup was overwhelming. I was worried this could be too sweet. After my first sip all fears were gone. There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said already in all the other reviews...this beer lived up to the hype. From flying across the country to Minneapolis, driving three hours each way to Decorah in mid-January to meeting some awesome people at the TG event to finally cracking KBBS, this is what the hobby of craft beer is all about!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Review from Pre Superbowl Whale share-"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 batch"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 vintage drank in the #proper KBBS 2016 glassware on 2/12/2017.  Bottle #438"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Had batch 1 KBBS side by side with SR71, Assassin, BVDL, DBH, BA Abraxas and a few others not worth mentioning. When sampling back and forth the KBBS stood out above all. Not only did the body dominate but the flavors did not fall off in any way after sampling other high abv stouts. The smell is very similar to taste. Strong Bourbon Maple with a great espresso finish. Best beer I've ever had."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","vintage 2016, First impression is the maple aroma is outstanding!  Pours a nice black color with tons of coffee, chocolate, with the perfect amount of barrel coming through.  Carbonation is spot on with a viscosity that is thicker than anything I've tried before.  Absolutly lives up to the hype! 5/5"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2106 vintage. Shared on 2/4/17. Bottle number 388. These TG stouts are crazy - they're like syrup. The scent is all maple, some coffee. Get a lot of hazelnut and coffee. Not much barrel - but it doesn't need it. Great, great beer."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 - Much stronger maple taste and smell then 2014, little barrel on either. Best beer I've ever had hands down."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Was able to track down a pour at RateBeerBest. This beer is like no other. The smell is of pure maple with a mouthfeel that goes right along with that smell. The taste is rich, chocolate, coffee,  and not overpowering with the sweetness. Still in awe of getting to taste a beer I've never thought I would even be able to lay eyes on in my lifetime."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Vintage 2016, bottle 391"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Appearance is black, staining the glass like soy sauce in a bottle, with an incredibly thin dark brown head, floating around like muddy soap suds. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Vintage 2016 poured in proper glassware. Maybe not as balanced as mornin delight b1 or as complex as sr-71, but this is a top tier beer. Mapple dominates over the coffee and whiskey. Definitely worth the hype."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Thick. maple. coffee.  Out of this world."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This beer is incredible. It pours very thick, with a hint of a mocha-colored head. The smell is dark chocolate,maple, coffee. This is the best aroma from a beer I've ever gotten. All the aromas blend together perfectly. The taste follows the nose. It is a little bit too sweet on the finish for me, but that's like saying Kate Upton's hair is too long, it's a personal critique of something (someone) that's damn near perfect. The mouthfeel is super viscous, and super great. I was scared this beer wouldn't live up to the hype, but it is most definitely, 100%, worth it. Amazing beer."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2016 bottle at Toppling Goliath poured into KBBS glass."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This blew me away. Probably drank this prematurely, but who cares."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Epic Lincoln, Nebraska share!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","'14 vintage, side by side with MD batch 2, SR-71 and yellow wax Assassin. Botlle generously shared by Chris at our Tasting to Sink all Sea Shepherds. Thanks a lot!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2014 Vintage, poured from the bottle into a taster. As close to a perfect beer as I've come across - great combination of maple, coffee and barrel that lingers for seemingly forever."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","If there's any beer that deserves the rating of a 5, it's this one. Generously shared by Clark at the Chainsmoker release on 9/16, 2014 Gold Wax version. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Pours black, no head at all. Sticky lacing is present. Overall, looks good. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Wow, seriously the perfect beer. I had this 2013 bottle about 6 months ago thanks to a good friend of mine, cheers! The mouthfeel, the viscosity, the coffee smell and taste, seriously, if there is a better beer out there I would love to try it side by side with this one. My only fault with this beer is that it only comes in 12 oz. and is nearly impossible to obtain."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","I had on 23rd of July '16 the KBBS '13 and '14 side by side and I have to say that there was a significant difference. The '13 was much better and the '14 still so boozy. The '13 lived up to the hype and was simply fantastic. A true whale if you love your stouts."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Lives up to the hype.  It has pretty amazing flavors and very well put together.  TG Barrel aging is one of the best out there.  Couldn't hate on this even if I wanted to."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Overall this is an incredible beer. It pours like motor oil, like every other TG stout. It smells like maple syrup, bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. Tastes exactly how it smells and coats your mouth as your drink it. So lucky to have tried this."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","I've had the 2014 twice, and it's hands down my favorite BA stout. The nose, body, and layers of complexity are absolutely extraordinary....maple, coffee, endless barrel....a work of art."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","(2014) Super balanced.Pours out black as night. Coffee, lots of maple syrup, bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt and sweetness. Getting some boozy heat and bitterness on the back end. Coats the mouth. No doubt this is world class, but I feel like I've had this before."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Bottle shared in London - big thanks to Jack. Pours thick black with a creamy brown head. The aroma is quite strong, with lots of charred wood up front, then secondary notes of dark chocolate and maple syrup. Big sweet flavor, oily, with bittersweet chocolate, baking cocoa, torched wood, earth, more maple syrup, figs, some coffee grounds. Full bodied, chewy, with moderate carbonation. Warm finish with loads of sticky chocolate sauce, well roasted malts, vanilla, char, maple, espresso, raisins, figs. Delicious. Robust yet still exceedingly drinkable. Exceptional."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Pours jet black, leaves a thick coating on the glass. Smell is of chocolate, coffee, and a mild, sweet bourbon. Taste is fantastic. Very sweet and thick. Main body is chocolate and coffee with a bourbon finish that blends perfectly with the beer. Lots of toasted marshmallow on the back end. Feel is very viscous. It coats the mouth the way it coats the glass. Overall my first 5/5."

"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout",Backlog:
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Split a bottle with 3 buddies at the MD release 8/29. This beer is world class for the style and 2nd to none. Perfect amounts of coffee, maple, and bourbon make this beer a standout."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This brew has been on my bucket list for  a while.  Thanks to Clark and the gang for busting it out at EBS when they were in town! "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This beer was nothing short of spectacular. A deep, rich black color with fantastic lacing. The nose was unctuous. There was big wafts of maple syrup, fudge, vanilla and a perfect roast bitterness from subtle hops and perhaps the char of the barrel. The mouthfeel matched every part of the nose on this beer. It was viscous and chewy, but the marriage of all of those huge flavors kept it from being a mess, which I can only imagine how hard that had to be to brew. Huge vanilla, pancake syrup, and a roasted twinge of coffee bitterness. What a remarkable beer. I shared this with three friends at TG. Bottle courtesy of TG. What a great crew."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","KBBS Vintage 2014 (x2)"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This is a good coffee stout, but it is blown way out of proportion due to its insanely limited availability and the fact that that availability makes it impossible to get a bottle without emptying your cellar.     The beer looks great- black as night with a beautiful head.   Smell is coffee and bourbon with a sugary sweetness behind it.   The sweetness is present in the taste as well, creating a somewhat uncomfortable mouth feel.    The coffee is outstanding, but the sweetness kills it for me.    I'd take BCBCS over this every day of the week."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Pure Heaven. SOOO DAMN TASTY. BEST STOUT I HAVE EVER HAD. Poured from 12 oz into a snifter dark black with virtually no head. What little head there is disappears into nothing very quickly. S- deep rich notes of roast, huge boozy bourbon followed by rich coffee. There is a subtle maple scent that follows the coffee in the back. T-  delicious flavor with the bourbon and the sweet vanilla, oak barrel. Lastly, after the swallow there's a strong maple presence that sits in your mouth for a long time and it develops and lasts for a long time and you don't want it to go away. Strong chocolate and vanilla notes also seep in during the mix. M- thick, creamy, velvety. The way a stout should feel. No carbonation. Completely coats your mouth and throat all the way down. O- Best stout i've every had. The flavors blend perfectly and each flavor is detectable. It's amazingly delicious."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Pours like all TG stouts which nearly equates to motor oil.  Of course the mouth feel will follow the pour which allows you to chew on the deliciousness that ensues.   Scent is roasted coffee with chocolate and maple.  Bit of booze in there as well.  Flavor is something I've yet to find any other beer match between the coffee, maple, chocolate, molasses and balanced mouthfeel that lets you mull this beer over a bit."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Black with tan head. Smells like overly sweet maple syrup and cloying molasses. Tastes even more sweet than it smells. Pure Aunt Jemima. Cloying. Hard to drink. Too thick. Don't see the hype. Sucks."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Disclaimer: I didnt want to love this beer, knowing how tough (impossible) it is to obtain."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Uber creamy, silky, and rich.... deep dark chocolate and raosty coffee with dark-maple flavors that linger a full minute or more.... you can literally taste this beer for awhile after your last sip.... decadent!!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","This was such an incredible beer. I truly never thought I would try it but yet again, a friend came through. So much maple and coffee on the nose. The beer itself is thick and palate coating. Perfect amount of sweetness from the maple, mixed with a complimentary but not overpowering touch of coffee. Truly world class. Gotta say...trades through the roof for a reason but it's a tiny bottle...hard pressed to ever catch me trading my cellar though."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Shared at DLD15. Silver wax. Served in a snifter."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","gold wax"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","KBBS '14 (gold wax/label).  Big thanks to @newbeeraday for sharing this bad boy!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Maple in the nose, maple and coffee on the tongue and maple in the backend.  Enjoyable and easy to drink. Not too hot, but slight bit of alcohol as it warmed."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Stunning.  No 12oz beer is worth what this costs to obtain but this is as close as it gets.  Nose is superb.  Smells of pure Maple.  The empty bottle still smelled days later.  Mouth feel was spot on as with all TG stouts.  Taste - it's just delicious.  Other beers are more complex (CBS for example) but this is just delicious.  Booze is well masked.  Easily in my top 4 beers."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Everything about KBBS was perfect. The mouthfeel is why this beer is a 5. It's so viscous and chewy. It's oily on the palate, it just slide around. The flavor is all coffee and maple. I wouldn't change a thing about this beer."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Pours a thick oily black with mild brown head. Super viscous with dark brown collar of head. The nose is heavy on coffee with notes of vanilla and maple. The coffee brings on a smokey character with heavy barrel char. The maple opens up more as it warms and melds beautifully with the coffee and cocoa. Super rich and decadent. Mouthfeel is perfect, silky and smooth. Overall, this beer is fantastic. Is it worth what it takes to get it? Probably not. Is it delicious? Hell yes. Glad to have gotten to try this!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Very fortunate to have a pour at a bottle share. This one lives up the considerable hype. Nice and viscous with wonderful coffee flavors balanced by sweetness from the maple syrup. Would love to try this one again, but that is probably a long shot."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Look- Sweet Dark nectar that is begging to be placed into your mouth."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Reviewed both vintages, both shortly after their respective taproom release. All I can say is this is the BEST beer I've ever had. What a treat."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","What can I say? Bar none the best beer I've ever had and absolutely worth the hype. 2014 gold wax poured into an open mouth wine glass. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Wow is all I have to say. Whatever it takes to get this beer do it, and don't think about it again. Opened a gold wax in the company of a few good men, basically what we call a normal Tuesday, whale slaying, gold wax from a Toppling Goliath snifter. The beer gave off the aromas of sweet brownies dipped in coffee, if that's a thing. Just understand that it was amazing, even before it touched my lips. As the beer traveled out of the glass into my mouth I began to levitate into the air, and fireworks were going off around me. Suddenly I realized I was actually hovering over my own self, watching myself drink this wonderful concoction. I recently had fresh CBS on tap, and thought that might be the pinnacle for my beer drinking of 2015, I was very wrong, that beer doesn't belong in the same sentence with KBBS. This is about as close to perfection in a beer that I believe is possible, especially for anyone who loves stouts. This is a must drink, must seek out beer, if only it was in a larger format."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","So ok, on the real, I gave up a ton for a couple of these bottles. And leading up to having it w some legendary DFW BA's I thought I wouldn't like it. I mean c'mon man, there's no way it could live up to the hype.man I've never been so beechwood aged wrong in my life."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Well done!  Thanks TG for this great beer.  Loved every drop.  Had a 2013.  Wow the Maple was in your face!!  After having a few more KBBS'S this year it has changed my opinion.  100 all day!!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Glad to have got the chance to try this. World-class? Yes. Was it better than Proprietor's, DBH, Masterpiece, Chez, various De Garde BUs, that we had at the same tasting? ... no."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Ive had the 2014 before, but I was lucky enough to be able to sit on the TG patio with Clark  and Mike BOTH and sample the 2013 & 2014 back to back!  Both are out of this world ridiculous with tons of barrel but the 2013 was smoother.  2014 had more coffee left in it."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. This is the 2014 gold wax version."

"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","12oz bottle, 2014 date with gold wax, poured into a Toppling Goliath teku. Enjoyed on 12.13.14, shared with my dad, review is from Tasting Journal."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Poured from 12 oz into a bourbon county snifter"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","What can I say, just a perfect beer!! Thick, well-balanced, and just flat out delicious. It will be interesting to see how the 2016 version compares if I can get my hands on one."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2014 release. Poured a thick, thick, thick stream. Little head with small pour, but carb is there. The nose is beautiful blend of coffee and maple, with slight bourbon, absolutely stunning. The taste is transcendental, follows the nose perfectly. Never anything ever come close to this in term of actually tasting the smell. This beer has the most incredible mouthfeel of any beer I've ever had, that's including Lawson's Maple Tripple which brewed entirely on maple syrup and Tree House Good Morning which absolutely killed it with the mouthfeel. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","2014 Vintage"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Pure heaven in a 12oz bottle.  Man I love maple beers and this is one of the best.   Tastes of barrel, maple syrup, chocolate, fudge, molasses, and a coffee finish.  And the aroma matches perfect.  This is a the best beer in the world.  It is best in every category.  If there was a 5+ rating this would be a 10."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Poor coffee stout with sweet maple and subpar whiskey. Sad. I didn't cough up an arm or leg for the bottle either. Maybe if I had lost a limb my rating would be higher. Meh."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","I liked it, but just dump 6 oz of maple syrup into a halfway decent ba stout and you'll get the same beer. And probably diabetes."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Many thanks to Patrick for sharing this at his birthday tasting!  "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Not as thick as I thought it would be, but this 2014 gold wax bottle has a great amount of maple syrup. Great balance all around! Glad I got to try this one, been waiting for awhile :)"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Bottle opened on 10/12/2014 graciously by @Hey5hitgoose.  2014 Vintage"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Bottle. Huge thanks to Hopscotch for sharing this bad mutha. Caramel and bourbon aromas. Joan Jett black pour with a brown head. Incredible mouthfeel and body. Delicious caramel, maple, dark chocolate, bourbon, dark roasted malts, and oaky notes. In my opinion the best of te three. I couldn’t think of a better beer for rating number 1400."

"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","review of 2014 Gold wax KBBS. First I would like to say that I have had a good 4 ounce pour of 2013 kbbs on two separate occasions and this 2014 was shared with my friend with 6oz pours each."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Picked up a 2014 bottle in the Brewery on the day of the release. Gold wax covers the cap down to the bottom of the neck of the bottle."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Served alongside Mornin' Delight and Assassin. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Was very happy to see the three bottle stout set arrive at my door, courtesy of cparles. Cheers! We drank Morning Delight, Assassin and KBBS, in that order. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Poured into a snifter glass, a dark chocolaty color. Can smell the aroma 2-3 feet away from the glass. A blend of whiskey, coffee, dark chocolate, and lots of that good ole molasses sweetness."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","The beer pours out extremely dark black like motor oil."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Poured into a snifter shared by Cory from Side Project. Got lucky and went back to talk to him about beer for a bit and this VB Assassin and Fuzzy were open."

"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Reviewed from notes from 1/1/14"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Pour is jet black with a tight mocha head. Nose is strong coffee, clean and roasted, notes of maple and vanilla with a well balanced bourbon and wood. Taste is a little sweeter, very big with lots of roasted coffee, well integrated bourbon and vanilla with some slightly charred wood, malt berry sweetness in the finish. Roast lingers, full bodied, creamy and moderate carbonation. Well balanced, lots of coffee with a fair bit of bourbon and malt sweetness, can get a hint sweet."

"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Reviewing the highly sought after Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout (KBBS) from my friends at the Toppling Goliath Brewery out of Decorah, Iowa. This beer is billed as a ""beer aged in whiskey barrels with coffee"" on the label."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Dark body, black with brown highlights. Viscous glass staining alcohol legs. Extremely short lived head."

"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","12oz bottle poured into HF stemmed glass, split three ways. Huge, huge thanks to Josh (thebigredone) for sending this to me!"
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","It angers me to write this. I really wanted this beer to be super overrated and to just be a product of Midwest people pumping up their instawalez. It's not. This is the best beer I've ever had. Smell, taste, lacing, everything is perfect. It smells like maple syrup with a hint of bourbon. It tastes like smooth maple syrup with a hint of bourbon. I never thought something non HF would become my favorite BA stout, but it has. Nice job Toppling Goliath. Please make this again. Soon."

Picked up at the release (where there were numerous Minnesota beer geeks in attendance) & this is the lone & single bottle resting in the fridge. Now resting in my glass. Well, half in my glass, half in my wife's glass. 12 oz. bottle with silver wax. "
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Bottled graciously shared by IPeeA. Looks like a double stout. Smell is a lot of coffee with just a little bourbon. Taste is unreal - again, lots of coffee which gives way to a mild bourbony sweetness. Not too boozy. Lives up to all the hype and then some."
"Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout","Bottle # 110 of 300. This bottle has been tempting me ever since it showed up on my doorstep. Thanks isn't enough to maximum12 for sending me a bottle completely unexpectedly."

Maple, bourbon, coffee and everything in a Melange and synergy that belies explanation. This is the benchmark beer for me here on. Wish I had more than one bottle on hand.

I am not a local, it took me 3 1/2 hours to drive here from Waukesha, WI. I can't buy TG in my area. I only state that as I feel many people are attributing the great scores on Mornin' Delight and KBBS to homerism."
