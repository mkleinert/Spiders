description
"Huge maple aroma right out of the gate and a vicious, dark pour. Maple dominates the nose but chocolate, barrel, and some coffee see also present. The mouth feel is massive and coats the mouth for days with adequate carbonation. It all makes for an impressive experience, but the taste falls well short of world class. There is a sour note that I also found in Mornin Delight. Some reviews have described it as coffee bitterness, but that's not what I get. It tastes like an off flavor. Since I've tasted the same thing twice I'm quite sure this isn't just a bad bottle. I'm not a fan of MD and the barrel aged version doesn't cover over the flaws."
"A delight for the senses. A perfect beer."
"2017 silver wax courtesy of Treyliff.  Coincidentally, this is also my 1,000th check in on BA.  "
"Where do I begin? Dark, rich appearance with creamy mocha brown head. Coffee, chocolate, maple, vanilla and other notes greet the nose after opening; it takes the room! You want to enjoy this before you sip....again sip, and let it rest on the palate. "
"2017 release"
"This beer was definitely on a different level. Everything about it was awesome."
"Low carbonation, attractive, but the immediately dissipating head renders it less than perfect. "
"Is it overhyped? Who knows. This is the rarest beer I've ever tried, and I doubt I'll try anything like this again. Once in a lifetime experience."
"2016 bottle shared with 2 others - 5 oz pour"
"2016 vintage. 6 oz pour into the TG KBBS glass.  Smells like a pancake breakfast complete with a neat bourbon. This beer melts in your mouth! Fudge fudge fudge with tons of maple that fades to barrel.  Sticks around in your mouth long after you swallow.  Lives up to the hype!"
"Great beer, still can't believe the secondary market on this one."
"It's really hard to rate a beer like this.  For what it goes for unless it gave me an orgasm while drinking I don't think it would ever be worth it unless I got it close to face value.  That being said I will do my best reviewing it.  Had a 2.5 oz. pour of a 2106 bottle at a share.  Had side by side with some great stous including SR-71, FVM, Assassin, MBP.  This is a really phenomenal maple bomb of a beer with some crazy complexity.  Maple dominated the nose and made it a little one dimensional yet it smelled great. Thought the coffee and barrel came through in the flavor. Another great maple beer I thought that I like the taste better as it had more richness to me was 2014 Beyond Good and Evil.  The mouthfeel is out of this world though.  It's a top notch beer and I would love a chance to have the 14 as 2 guys at the share said that was the very best beer they've ever had.  On this day SR-71 stood as king in my eyes.  Is it worth the price of admission?  No, no beer is worse this much, but I understand why people are willing to pay this much and I do understand the ticker mentality as that is what drove me to try this beer."
"I am going to need to revisit all my prior ratings as this one literally does take the cake! With so much hype yet it completely lives up to it. Shared by a great beer friend, 2016 vintage into smaller taster. Nose was simply incredible, super chocolaty, slight maple sweetness and subtle barrel oak and char notes.  Thick and viscous pour and close to pitch black. Tastes likes bittersweet bakers chocolate liquefied and infused with rich sweet maple syrup. The maple is more pronounced on the tast and the barrel notes follow. Honestly could have just smelled the beer all night, simply intoxicating. Glad I got the pleasure and treat to try this from the most generous beer buddy."
"Note: This review is based on the '13 vintage."
"Batch 3."
"L: It pours like you might think. Black, viscous(like really, used cold engine oil thick) and next to no head. It coats like none I have ever seen."
"L: completely satins the glass."
"This beer was amazing...maple fudginess in a glass--a 2 oz sample in a sampler glass. The only knock I could consider was the price on the secondary market, but as a beer itself definitely one of the best I've had!!!"
"2016 vintage, bottle #80.  Roughly 4 oz pour into a white wine glass.  The balance of maple and coffee on both the nose and taste is truly remarkable.  I can't begin to explain or understand how a beer delivering so much flavor with this level of viscosity doesn't turn into a sweet diabetes bomb.  The mouthfeel is unreal; a velvet-like texture I've never quite experienced.  "
"2016 out of an Assassin Teku. "
"I am not one to get on hype trains about beers. BUUUUTT. This beer lives up to its hype. Thick, dark, molasses type consisitency pour with little head. Smells of coffee and maple syrup. Tastes like a coffee brownie. And about as thick as one. INCREDIBLE BEER!"
"From the breweries I unwaxed and unlabeled bottle."
"My girlfriend who won the TG lottery and I shared this bottle tonight for my 34th birthday. When we cracked the bottle the smell of maple syrup was overwhelming. I was worried this could be too sweet. After my first sip all fears were gone. There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said already in all the other reviews...this beer lived up to the hype. From flying across the country to Minneapolis, driving three hours each way to Decorah in mid-January to meeting some awesome people at the TG event to finally cracking KBBS, this is what the hobby of craft beer is all about!"
"Review from Pre Superbowl Whale share-"
"2016 batch"
"2016 vintage drank in the #proper KBBS 2016 glassware on 2/12/2017.  Bottle #438"
"Had batch 1 KBBS side by side with SR71, Assassin, BVDL, DBH, BA Abraxas and a few others not worth mentioning. When sampling back and forth the KBBS stood out above all. Not only did the body dominate but the flavors did not fall off in any way after sampling other high abv stouts. The smell is very similar to taste. Strong Bourbon Maple with a great espresso finish. Best beer I've ever had."
"vintage 2016, First impression is the maple aroma is outstanding!  Pours a nice black color with tons of coffee, chocolate, with the perfect amount of barrel coming through.  Carbonation is spot on with a viscosity that is thicker than anything I've tried before.  Absolutly lives up to the hype! 5/5"
"2106 vintage. Shared on 2/4/17. Bottle number 388. These TG stouts are crazy - they're like syrup. The scent is all maple, some coffee. Get a lot of hazelnut and coffee. Not much barrel - but it doesn't need it. Great, great beer."
"2016 - Much stronger maple taste and smell then 2014, little barrel on either. Best beer I've ever had hands down."
"Was able to track down a pour at RateBeerBest. This beer is like no other. The smell is of pure maple with a mouthfeel that goes right along with that smell. The taste is rich, chocolate, coffee,  and not overpowering with the sweetness. Still in awe of getting to taste a beer I've never thought I would even be able to lay eyes on in my lifetime."
"Vintage 2016, bottle 391"
"Appearance is black, staining the glass like soy sauce in a bottle, with an incredibly thin dark brown head, floating around like muddy soap suds. "
"Vintage 2016 poured in proper glassware. Maybe not as balanced as mornin delight b1 or as complex as sr-71, but this is a top tier beer. Mapple dominates over the coffee and whiskey. Definitely worth the hype."
"Thick. maple. coffee.  Out of this world."
"This beer is incredible. It pours very thick, with a hint of a mocha-colored head. The smell is dark chocolate,maple, coffee. This is the best aroma from a beer I've ever gotten. All the aromas blend together perfectly. The taste follows the nose. It is a little bit too sweet on the finish for me, but that's like saying Kate Upton's hair is too long, it's a personal critique of something (someone) that's damn near perfect. The mouthfeel is super viscous, and super great. I was scared this beer wouldn't live up to the hype, but it is most definitely, 100%, worth it. Amazing beer."
"2016 bottle at Toppling Goliath poured into KBBS glass."
"This blew me away. Probably drank this prematurely, but who cares."
"Epic Lincoln, Nebraska share!"
"'14 vintage, side by side with MD batch 2, SR-71 and yellow wax Assassin. Botlle generously shared by Chris at our Tasting to Sink all Sea Shepherds. Thanks a lot!"
"2014 Vintage, poured from the bottle into a taster. As close to a perfect beer as I've come across - great combination of maple, coffee and barrel that lingers for seemingly forever."
"If there's any beer that deserves the rating of a 5, it's this one. Generously shared by Clark at the Chainsmoker release on 9/16, 2014 Gold Wax version. "
"Pours black, no head at all. Sticky lacing is present. Overall, looks good. "
"Wow, seriously the perfect beer. I had this 2013 bottle about 6 months ago thanks to a good friend of mine, cheers! The mouthfeel, the viscosity, the coffee smell and taste, seriously, if there is a better beer out there I would love to try it side by side with this one. My only fault with this beer is that it only comes in 12 oz. and is nearly impossible to obtain."
"I had on 23rd of July '16 the KBBS '13 and '14 side by side and I have to say that there was a significant difference. The '13 was much better and the '14 still so boozy. The '13 lived up to the hype and was simply fantastic. A true whale if you love your stouts."
"Lives up to the hype.  It has pretty amazing flavors and very well put together.  TG Barrel aging is one of the best out there.  Couldn't hate on this even if I wanted to."
"Overall this is an incredible beer. It pours like motor oil, like every other TG stout. It smells like maple syrup, bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. Tastes exactly how it smells and coats your mouth as your drink it. So lucky to have tried this."
"I've had the 2014 twice, and it's hands down my favorite BA stout. The nose, body, and layers of complexity are absolutely extraordinary....maple, coffee, endless barrel....a work of art."
"(2014) Super balanced.Pours out black as night. Coffee, lots of maple syrup, bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt and sweetness. Getting some boozy heat and bitterness on the back end. Coats the mouth. No doubt this is world class, but I feel like I've had this before."
"Bottle shared in London - big thanks to Jack. Pours thick black with a creamy brown head. The aroma is quite strong, with lots of charred wood up front, then secondary notes of dark chocolate and maple syrup. Big sweet flavor, oily, with bittersweet chocolate, baking cocoa, torched wood, earth, more maple syrup, figs, some coffee grounds. Full bodied, chewy, with moderate carbonation. Warm finish with loads of sticky chocolate sauce, well roasted malts, vanilla, char, maple, espresso, raisins, figs. Delicious. Robust yet still exceedingly drinkable. Exceptional."
"Pours jet black, leaves a thick coating on the glass. Smell is of chocolate, coffee, and a mild, sweet bourbon. Taste is fantastic. Very sweet and thick. Main body is chocolate and coffee with a bourbon finish that blends perfectly with the beer. Lots of toasted marshmallow on the back end. Feel is very viscous. It coats the mouth the way it coats the glass. Overall my first 5/5."
"Kbbs '14"
"Black and thick. Tan head. Nose is perfect with huge maple syrup and coffee. Bourbon and vanilla. Best breakfast ever. "
Backlog:
"Split a bottle with 3 buddies at the MD release 8/29. This beer is world class for the style and 2nd to none. Perfect amounts of coffee, maple, and bourbon make this beer a standout."
"This brew has been on my bucket list for  a while.  Thanks to Clark and the gang for busting it out at EBS when they were in town! "
"This beer was nothing short of spectacular. A deep, rich black color with fantastic lacing. The nose was unctuous. There was big wafts of maple syrup, fudge, vanilla and a perfect roast bitterness from subtle hops and perhaps the char of the barrel. The mouthfeel matched every part of the nose on this beer. It was viscous and chewy, but the marriage of all of those huge flavors kept it from being a mess, which I can only imagine how hard that had to be to brew. Huge vanilla, pancake syrup, and a roasted twinge of coffee bitterness. What a remarkable beer. I shared this with three friends at TG. Bottle courtesy of TG. What a great crew."
"KBBS Vintage 2014 (x2)"
"This is a good coffee stout, but it is blown way out of proportion due to its insanely limited availability and the fact that that availability makes it impossible to get a bottle without emptying your cellar.     The beer looks great- black as night with a beautiful head.   Smell is coffee and bourbon with a sugary sweetness behind it.   The sweetness is present in the taste as well, creating a somewhat uncomfortable mouth feel.    The coffee is outstanding, but the sweetness kills it for me.    I'd take BCBCS over this every day of the week."
"Pure Heaven. SOOO DAMN TASTY. BEST STOUT I HAVE EVER HAD. Poured from 12 oz into a snifter dark black with virtually no head. What little head there is disappears into nothing very quickly. S- deep rich notes of roast, huge boozy bourbon followed by rich coffee. There is a subtle maple scent that follows the coffee in the back. T-  delicious flavor with the bourbon and the sweet vanilla, oak barrel. Lastly, after the swallow there's a strong maple presence that sits in your mouth for a long time and it develops and lasts for a long time and you don't want it to go away. Strong chocolate and vanilla notes also seep in during the mix. M- thick, creamy, velvety. The way a stout should feel. No carbonation. Completely coats your mouth and throat all the way down. O- Best stout i've every had. The flavors blend perfectly and each flavor is detectable. It's amazingly delicious."
"Pours like all TG stouts which nearly equates to motor oil.  Of course the mouth feel will follow the pour which allows you to chew on the deliciousness that ensues.   Scent is roasted coffee with chocolate and maple.  Bit of booze in there as well.  Flavor is something I've yet to find any other beer match between the coffee, maple, chocolate, molasses and balanced mouthfeel that lets you mull this beer over a bit."
"Black with tan head. Smells like overly sweet maple syrup and cloying molasses. Tastes even more sweet than it smells. Pure Aunt Jemima. Cloying. Hard to drink. Too thick. Don't see the hype. Sucks."
"Disclaimer: I didnt want to love this beer, knowing how tough (impossible) it is to obtain."
"Uber creamy, silky, and rich.... deep dark chocolate and raosty coffee with dark-maple flavors that linger a full minute or more.... you can literally taste this beer for awhile after your last sip.... decadent!!"
"This was such an incredible beer. I truly never thought I would try it but yet again, a friend came through. So much maple and coffee on the nose. The beer itself is thick and palate coating. Perfect amount of sweetness from the maple, mixed with a complimentary but not overpowering touch of coffee. Truly world class. Gotta say...trades through the roof for a reason but it's a tiny bottle...hard pressed to ever catch me trading my cellar though."
"Shared at DLD15. Silver wax. Served in a snifter."
"gold wax"
"KBBS '14 (gold wax/label).  Big thanks to @newbeeraday for sharing this bad boy!"
"Maple in the nose, maple and coffee on the tongue and maple in the backend.  Enjoyable and easy to drink. Not too hot, but slight bit of alcohol as it warmed."
"Stunning.  No 12oz beer is worth what this costs to obtain but this is as close as it gets.  Nose is superb.  Smells of pure Maple.  The empty bottle still smelled days later.  Mouth feel was spot on as with all TG stouts.  Taste - it's just delicious.  Other beers are more complex (CBS for example) but this is just delicious.  Booze is well masked.  Easily in my top 4 beers."
"Everything about KBBS was perfect. The mouthfeel is why this beer is a 5. It's so viscous and chewy. It's oily on the palate, it just slide around. The flavor is all coffee and maple. I wouldn't change a thing about this beer."
"Pours a thick oily black with mild brown head. Super viscous with dark brown collar of head. The nose is heavy on coffee with notes of vanilla and maple. The coffee brings on a smokey character with heavy barrel char. The maple opens up more as it warms and melds beautifully with the coffee and cocoa. Super rich and decadent. Mouthfeel is perfect, silky and smooth. Overall, this beer is fantastic. Is it worth what it takes to get it? Probably not. Is it delicious? Hell yes. Glad to have gotten to try this!"
"Very fortunate to have a pour at a bottle share. This one lives up the considerable hype. Nice and viscous with wonderful coffee flavors balanced by sweetness from the maple syrup. Would love to try this one again, but that is probably a long shot."
"Look- Sweet Dark nectar that is begging to be placed into your mouth."
"Reviewed both vintages, both shortly after their respective taproom release. All I can say is this is the BEST beer I've ever had. What a treat."
"What can I say? Bar none the best beer I've ever had and absolutely worth the hype. 2014 gold wax poured into an open mouth wine glass. "
"Wow is all I have to say. Whatever it takes to get this beer do it, and don't think about it again. Opened a gold wax in the company of a few good men, basically what we call a normal Tuesday, whale slaying, gold wax from a Toppling Goliath snifter. The beer gave off the aromas of sweet brownies dipped in coffee, if that's a thing. Just understand that it was amazing, even before it touched my lips. As the beer traveled out of the glass into my mouth I began to levitate into the air, and fireworks were going off around me. Suddenly I realized I was actually hovering over my own self, watching myself drink this wonderful concoction. I recently had fresh CBS on tap, and thought that might be the pinnacle for my beer drinking of 2015, I was very wrong, that beer doesn't belong in the same sentence with KBBS. This is about as close to perfection in a beer that I believe is possible, especially for anyone who loves stouts. This is a must drink, must seek out beer, if only it was in a larger format."
"So ok, on the real, I gave up a ton for a couple of these bottles. And leading up to having it w some legendary DFW BA's I thought I wouldn't like it. I mean c'mon man, there's no way it could live up to the hype.man I've never been so beechwood aged wrong in my life."
"Well done!  Thanks TG for this great beer.  Loved every drop.  Had a 2013.  Wow the Maple was in your face!!  After having a few more KBBS'S this year it has changed my opinion.  100 all day!!"
"Glad to have got the chance to try this. World-class? Yes. Was it better than Proprietor's, DBH, Masterpiece, Chez, various De Garde BUs, that we had at the same tasting? ... no."
"Ive had the 2014 before, but I was lucky enough to be able to sit on the TG patio with Clark  and Mike BOTH and sample the 2013 & 2014 back to back!  Both are out of this world ridiculous with tons of barrel but the 2013 was smoother.  2014 had more coffee left in it."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. This is the 2014 gold wax version."
rb
"12oz bottle, 2014 date with gold wax, poured into a Toppling Goliath teku. Enjoyed on 12.13.14, shared with my dad, review is from Tasting Journal."
"Poured from 12 oz into a bourbon county snifter"
"What can I say, just a perfect beer!! Thick, well-balanced, and just flat out delicious. It will be interesting to see how the 2016 version compares if I can get my hands on one."
"2014 release. Poured a thick, thick, thick stream. Little head with small pour, but carb is there. The nose is beautiful blend of coffee and maple, with slight bourbon, absolutely stunning. The taste is transcendental, follows the nose perfectly. Never anything ever come close to this in term of actually tasting the smell. This beer has the most incredible mouthfeel of any beer I've ever had, that's including Lawson's Maple Tripple which brewed entirely on maple syrup and Tree House Good Morning which absolutely killed it with the mouthfeel. "
"2014 Vintage"
"Pure heaven in a 12oz bottle.  Man I love maple beers and this is one of the best.   Tastes of barrel, maple syrup, chocolate, fudge, molasses, and a coffee finish.  And the aroma matches perfect.  This is a the best beer in the world.  It is best in every category.  If there was a 5+ rating this would be a 10."
"Poor coffee stout with sweet maple and subpar whiskey. Sad. I didn't cough up an arm or leg for the bottle either. Maybe if I had lost a limb my rating would be higher. Meh."
"I liked it, but just dump 6 oz of maple syrup into a halfway decent ba stout and you'll get the same beer. And probably diabetes."
"Many thanks to Patrick for sharing this at his birthday tasting!  "
"Not as thick as I thought it would be, but this 2014 gold wax bottle has a great amount of maple syrup. Great balance all around! Glad I got to try this one, been waiting for awhile :)"
"Bottle opened on 10/12/2014 graciously by @Hey5hitgoose.  2014 Vintage"
"Bottle. Huge thanks to Hopscotch for sharing this bad mutha. Caramel and bourbon aromas. Joan Jett black pour with a brown head. Incredible mouthfeel and body. Delicious caramel, maple, dark chocolate, bourbon, dark roasted malts, and oaky notes. In my opinion the best of te three. I couldn’t think of a better beer for rating number 1400."
"2014 gold wax bottle. Poured into a snifter."
"review of 2014 Gold wax KBBS. First I would like to say that I have had a good 4 ounce pour of 2013 kbbs on two separate occasions and this 2014 was shared with my friend with 6oz pours each."
"Picked up a 2014 bottle in the Brewery on the day of the release. Gold wax covers the cap down to the bottom of the neck of the bottle."
"Served alongside Mornin' Delight and Assassin. "
"Was very happy to see the three bottle stout set arrive at my door, courtesy of cparles. Cheers! We drank Morning Delight, Assassin and KBBS, in that order. "
"Poured into a snifter glass, a dark chocolaty color. Can smell the aroma 2-3 feet away from the glass. A blend of whiskey, coffee, dark chocolate, and lots of that good ole molasses sweetness."
"The beer pours out extremely dark black like motor oil."
"Poured into a snifter shared by Cory from Side Project. Got lucky and went back to talk to him about beer for a bit and this VB Assassin and Fuzzy were open."
"Twice I've had this beer, both times amid a sea of other world class beers, and both times none of those even came close."
"Reviewed from notes from 1/1/14"
"Pour is jet black with a tight mocha head. Nose is strong coffee, clean and roasted, notes of maple and vanilla with a well balanced bourbon and wood. Taste is a little sweeter, very big with lots of roasted coffee, well integrated bourbon and vanilla with some slightly charred wood, malt berry sweetness in the finish. Roast lingers, full bodied, creamy and moderate carbonation. Well balanced, lots of coffee with a fair bit of bourbon and malt sweetness, can get a hint sweet."
"Silver Wax (2013) 12oz bottle"
"12oz bottle shared during Christmas Eve with friends into Utopias glass."
"A - Luscious black with a lasting caramel head"
"A - Very dark, slight tan head. It looks nice."
"Reviewing the highly sought after Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout (KBBS) from my friends at the Toppling Goliath Brewery out of Decorah, Iowa. This beer is billed as a ""beer aged in whiskey barrels with coffee"" on the label."
"Dark body, black with brown highlights. Viscous glass staining alcohol legs. Extremely short lived head."
"Served in a standing stone snifter, stored at 40 degrees since release at T.G."
"12oz bottle poured into HF stemmed glass, split three ways. Huge, huge thanks to Josh (thebigredone) for sending this to me!"
"It angers me to write this. I really wanted this beer to be super overrated and to just be a product of Midwest people pumping up their instawalez. It's not. This is the best beer I've ever had. Smell, taste, lacing, everything is perfect. It smells like maple syrup with a hint of bourbon. It tastes like smooth maple syrup with a hint of bourbon. I never thought something non HF would become my favorite BA stout, but it has. Nice job Toppling Goliath. Please make this again. Soon."
"12 oz. staff bottle split 4 ways."
"Reviewed from notes and then bottle today."
"A huge thanks to Mike for this one. 12oz. bottle shared with jbuddle and POTABLE83. #155/300 into Torst stemware. Reviewed from notes. "
"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. No bottle number."
"OK, time to drown this puppy. Picked up at the release (where there were numerous Minnesota beer geeks in attendance) & this is the lone & single bottle resting in the fridge. Now resting in my glass. Well, half in my glass, half in my wife's glass. 12 oz. bottle with silver wax. "
"Bottled graciously shared by IPeeA. Looks like a double stout. Smell is a lot of coffee with just a little bourbon. Taste is unreal - again, lots of coffee which gives way to a mild bourbony sweetness. Not too boozy. Lives up to all the hype and then some."
"Bottle # 110 of 300. This bottle has been tempting me ever since it showed up on my doorstep. Thanks isn't enough to maximum12 for sending me a bottle completely unexpectedly."
"First and foremost a big thanks to roon for sending me this bottle via his LIF."
"Look- This beer pours as dark as midnight. "
"I have been to the top of the mountain and they have Kentucky brunch on tap there. Maple, bourbon, coffee and everything in a Melange and synergy that belies explanation. This is the benchmark beer for me here on. Wish I had more than one bottle on hand. It will have ato be a special occasion for me to crack it. VERY SPECIAL"
"Bottle number 240 of 300, purchased at the release."
"poured into a duvil ""like"" tulip glass by Toppling Goliath staff."
"This was my first beer of the day at the release. "
"Let's start this revew by saying that I have never had a Toppling Goliath brew before, this was my first. I am not a local, it took me 3 1/2 hours to drive here from Waukesha, WI. I can't buy TG in my area. I only state that as I feel many people are attributing the great scores on Mornin' Delight and KBBS to homerism."
"On tap at Toppling Goliath on release day. Served in a Duvel style tulip."
"This was served in a chalice-tulip. I reviewed this from notes. "
"Poured from tap into Chalice approximately 12 ounces."
